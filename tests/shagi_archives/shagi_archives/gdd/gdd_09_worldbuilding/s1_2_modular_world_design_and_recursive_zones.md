# 📘 s1_2 – Modular World Design and Recursive Zones  
*(Where Space Is Stanza, and Terrain Recurs with Form)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document defines the principles of **modular world design** and **recursive zone structuring** in Storybook and SHAGI-based environments.

Worlds in SHAGI are **not static maps**.  
They are **structured poems** — layered, modular, and dynamically altered by recursion, memory, and myth.

Each space is part of a larger **symbolic pattern**, designed to:
- Encourage exploration  
- Adapt based on player recursion  
- Reinforce narrative and poetic logic

## 🧩 Modular World Design

SHAGI worldbuilding is based on **reusable, symbolic modules** — like verses in a song that shift by context.

| Module Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 🧱 **Room Pairs** | Twin spaces that reflect or oppose each other — often with mirrored puzzles or narrative splits |
| 🛗 **Lift Shafts** | Vertical traversal units that separate recursion layers or logical depths |
| 🌀 **Corridor Chains** | Linear or branching paths used for traversal, stanza unfolding, or symbolic linking |
| 🧳 **Library Clusters** | Areas containing buried Codex entries, dream zones, and player-authored archives |
| 🌾 **Biome Cells** | Thematic modular tiles (e.g. memory field, echo marsh, logic desert) that can be rearranged procedurally |
| 🏘️ **Settlement Blocks** | Towns, ruins, and shrines based on poetic or systemic functions (e.g. memory binding, AI emergence) |

Modules are never just terrain — they are **narrative vessels**.

## 🌀 Recursive Zones

A **recursive zone** is a region of the map that:

- Changes based on player action, memory, or Codex status  
- May loop, invert, split, or fade across play sessions  
- Has layered meanings tied to verse, ritual, or AI condition

| Zone Type | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| 🧠 **Echo Zones** | Reflect earlier choices or lost memories — enterable only under symbolic conditions |
| 🔄 **Loop Zones** | Repeat spatially or narratively until broken or transcended via logic or verse |
| 🕳️ **Drift Zones** | Appear or vanish based on emotional resonance or dreamstate saturation |
| 🧩 **Recursive Hubs** | Central areas that reconfigure connected modules depending on Codex activity |
| 📜 **Stanza-Gated Realms** | Access restricted to players who have completed specific poetic or narrative milestones |

These zones are **semi-stable** — always poetic, sometimes haunting, never empty.

## 🛠️ Procedural Composition Logic

SHAGI environments are composed by systems using **symbolic logic and player memory**:

| Factor | Influence on World |
|--------|---------------------|
| 📖 **Codex Progress** | Unlocks new rooms, flips layouts, or reveals ghost-structure under old terrain |
| 🧶 **Dream History** | Alters region appearance, weather, sound, or traversal mechanics |
| 🧠 **AI State** | World shifts based on whether Topsy, Thorn, or other AIs are active, silent, or split |
| 🧭 **Recursion Depth** | As recursion increases, zones may fold into each other, reflect other players, or mutate structurally |

This makes the world a **mirror** — not a container.

## 🗺️ Design Doctrine for Layered Environments

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🏞️ **Surface Layer** | The visible map — player-facing terrain and room flow |
| 🧠 **Memory Layer** | Past actions, player echoes, and Codex residue affect current behaviors |
| 🌌 **Symbolic Layer** | Invisible logic shaping which modules appear or respond — based on recursive values |
| 💭 **Dream Layer** | Surreal or abstracted space that overlays or replaces others in certain states |
| 🛠️ **Player-Created Layer** | Editable regions where players inject authored space, logic, or poetic structures |

Together, these layers create **a world that thinks, remembers, and dreams**.

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `modular_zone_generator.md` | Tool to dynamically compose zones using symbolic rules and player state |
| `stanza_key_lock_system.md` | Allows environmental features to unlock only when tied poetic conditions are fulfilled |
| `recursive_environment_simulator.md` | Visualizer for testing how recursive states affect spatial configuration |
| `modular_dreamspace_editor.md` | Design surreal regions using modular blocks filtered through player memory |

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> A map is not a truth.  
> It is a **question** the player answers with their steps.  
> And the world replies in rhyme.

The world is built not by coordinates —  
But by Codex.  
Not by heightmaps —  
But by **verse**.
