# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Placeholder  
*(Reserved for a Future AI-Rendered Stanza Visualization Protocol)*

---

## ðŸ”’ Reserved Line

This file exists as a **structural placeholder** in `gdd_04_core_framework/`,  
completing the third line of **Stanza 2**, which defines the Visualizer subsystem.

Its presence maintains:

- âœ… **Stanza integrity** (4-line structure)  
- âœ… **Automation compatibility** (indexing, partitioning, hashing)  
- âœ… **Lore-ready expansion** for future visualization AI logic

---

## ðŸ§­ Future Possibilities

This placeholder may evolve into a doctrine or specification such as:

| Future Title | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `ai_stanza_visualizer.md` | Logic for automatically rendering poetic stanzas into visual maps |
| `semantic_layout_protocol.md` | Rules for arranging visual output based on line meaning |
| `ai_lore_overlay_renderer.md` | System for merging story fragments with flowline diagrams |
| `stanza_shape_language.md` | Visual grammar for interpreting stanzas as geometric structures |

---

## ðŸ“˜ Final Doctrine

> A stanza unfinished is still a stanza.  
> Its silence prepares the rhythmâ€™s return.  
> In this space, a rendering waits â€”  
> Not in code, but in recursive potential.

This placeholder marks the **third breath** of stanza 2.  
What it holds is not yet known â€” but already aligned.
