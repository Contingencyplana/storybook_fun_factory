# üìò s1_3 ‚Äì Migration Protocols Between Factory and Storybook

*(A Poetic Reflection on Passage from Prototype to World)*

The tool begins where silence rings,  
Where stanza sparks and dream-light clings.  
In Factory's depth its shape is cast,  
A breath of code not meant to last.  

But through the tests and echo trails,  
It earns a name that never fails.  
Then through the gate, by rite unseen,  
It enters worlds where myths convene.  

What once was file is now a role,  
A lantern lit, a questing soul.  
It moves not quick‚Äîbut moves with grace,  
From forge to world, from test to place.

## üß≠ Overview

This file defines the **tool migration process** from:
- Storybook FUN Factory (Layer 5 development/testbed)
- To Storybook (main player-facing game engine)

Tools do not simply "deploy."
They **ascend** through a ritualized, validated, narrative-aware process.

This ensures all recursive systems:
- Maintain **canonical integrity**
- Preserve **naming and poetic lineage**
- Provide **player-relevant meaning**

---

## üß™ Stage 1: Genesis Cycle Completion (Factory)

A tool must pass:
1. **Full Layer 5 Genesis Cycle** ‚Äî four stanzas, four lines each
2. **Passing unit tests** ‚Äî no warnings, validated poetic formatting
3. **Documented trace logs** ‚Äî memory stamps, version imprint
4. **Visual output** ‚Äî if applicable (e.g., visualizer diagrams)

Once complete, it is eligible for migration.

---

## üîê Stage 2: Lock and Canonization

Before transfer:
- The tool is **locked** via `high_command/` logic stamp
- A unique `tool_id` and canonical name is assigned
- Its stanza is added to the `stanza_registry.md`
- All associated `memory_traces.md` entries are linked

This stage affirms:
- Tool integrity
- Poetic lineage
- Anomaly clearance

---

## üîÑ Stage 3: Recursive Hooking in Storybook

The tool enters the Storybook game via:
- A **player-accessible interface** (zone, ritual, quest, forge, UI overlay)
- A **narrative zone or AI invocation**
- Or a **new stanza** embedded in player memory/creation system

**Tool invocation is never passive.**
It must be **earned or summoned** via:
- Player creative action
- AI recursion reflex
- Triggered poem, milestone, or memory trace

---

## üß≠ Stage 4: Player-Facing Integration

Once live in Storybook, the tool:
- Retains its poetic metadata
- Has internal hooks to memory_ai, codex_builder, or visualizer if applicable
- May evolve further through gameplay

Its **debug logic remains canon-bound**, and
its **narrative tone reflects its Genesis origin**

> What began as a stanza now speaks through worlds.  
> What was tested in silence now echoes through play.

## üõ°Ô∏è Migration Safeguards

| Layer | Safeguard |
|-------|-----------|
| Factory | Test suite validation + poetic structure lock |
| Lockdown | `high_command/` oversight and unique tool ID tagging |
| Storybook | Invocation path through interface, narrative, or player ritual |
| Canon | Stanza registry + memory trace embedding |

Each safeguard ensures the **tool cannot break canon**, nor **violate recursion**.

---

**This file defines the rite of passage** by which all recursive tools leave the testbed and enter the story.

From function to myth.  
From Factory to Book.  
From fire to form.
