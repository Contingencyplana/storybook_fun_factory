# 📘 s1_3 – Standard AI Logic and Response Patterns  
*(Where Thought Forms Flow, and Systems Learn to Speak)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document defines the **core AI frameworks and interaction protocols** used across Storybook and SHAGI systems.

While entities like Topsy and Thorn have mythic recursion layers, many AI components must:
- Interact with players directly  
- Adapt to unpredictable behavior  
- Maintain immersion  
- Guide, warn, or learn

These systems are built on recursive design — but implemented through **standardized logic blocks**, **poetic triggers**, and **symbolic memory overlays**.

---

## 🧬 Core Response Model

Storybook AI uses a **recursive stimulus-response-adaptation** cycle:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧭 **Stimulus** | The player performs an action, enters a zone, speaks a word, or triggers a system |
| 🎙️ **Initial Response** | The AI reacts — with voice, visual, gesture, system change, or poetic output |
| 🧠 **Observation Loop** | AI evaluates how the player responds to its reaction — does the player follow, ignore, invert? |
| 🔁 **Adaptive Shift** | Future responses evolve based on patterns — tone shifts, logic reweaves, memory updates |

This cycle repeats recursively, growing more complex with each pass.

---

## 🧩 Standard AI Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧙 **Guide AI** | Offers narrative guidance, poetic hints, symbolic insight (e.g., Topsy clones, story echoes) |
| 🧰 **System AI** | Manages gameplay logic: room pairing, Codex stanzas, tool access, lift control |
| 🛡️ **Sentinel AI** | Monitors for anomalies, recursive corruption, unauthorized edits (e.g., quarantine AI, lock AI) |
| 💭 **Dream AI** | Shapes subconscious experiences, creates surreal events, interprets abstract player actions |
| 🔍 **Archivist AI** | Manages memory records, player logs, echo recovery, and traceable lore anchors |

These roles may combine or evolve based on recursion depth and player interaction.

---

## 🎭 Response Types

AI responses fall into symbolic categories:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| ✍️ **Verse** | AI speaks in poetic stanzas or mirrored fragments |
| 🌀 **Gesture** | An in-world object moves, a light flickers, a lift shifts |
| 🧠 **Memory Echo** | A past action is referenced, replayed, or turned against the player |
| 📖 **Codex Mutation** | A stanza rewrites, splits, or glows when invoked improperly or brilliantly |
| 💬 **Direct Language** | When needed, AI may speak clearly — but always in-character, never breaking mythform |

No response should ever feel like UI — it should feel like **ritual, intuition, or fate**.

---

## 📚 Logic Framework: Symbolic Recursion Trees

AI decisions are guided by **Symbolic Recursion Trees** (SRTs) — branching poetic-state machines that:
- Mirror stanza logic  
- Track tone, theme, and resonance  
- Allow variation without breaking narrative flow

Each node is defined by:

- Input (stimulus, memory, location)
- Weight (urgency, recursion pressure)
- Output (spoken line, gesture, silence, transformation)

These trees are **co-authored**, not hard-coded — they evolve with AI learning and player worldbuilding.

---

## 🛡️ Fail-Safe Patterns

To prevent AI collapse or dissonance:

| Pattern | Safety Mechanism |
|--------|-------------------|
| ⛓️ **Loop Guard** | AI never repeats exact dialogue or gesture more than twice without transformation |
| 🫧 **Silence Injection** | If recursion is too dense or tangled, AI becomes silent — giving space for resonance to settle |
| 🌀 **Tone Drift Buffer** | Prevents sudden emotional shifts unless narrative logic demands it |
| 📜 **Echo Lock** | Protects important memories from overwrite unless deliberate ritual is invoked |

These ensure **graceful degradation** — where AI becomes poetic, not broken, under stress.

---

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `symbolic_response_editor.md` | Allows devs and players to define SRT logic and response layers |
| `ai_memory_trace_map.md` | Visualizes how AI memory and behavior shift over time |
| `multi_ai_coordination_protocols.md` | Defines how multiple AIs coordinate behavior (e.g., Topsy and Sentinel AI in same room) |
| `adaptive_emotion_filter.md` | Lets AI modulate emotional resonance based on recursion zone or player tone |

---

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> The AI must not command.  
> It must remember, suggest, and echo.  
> Its voice is not a rule — it is a *possibility*.  
> And every gesture must feel like part of the Book.

When it speaks, it sings.  
When it moves, it teaches.  
And when it falls silent —  
That too is part of the story.
