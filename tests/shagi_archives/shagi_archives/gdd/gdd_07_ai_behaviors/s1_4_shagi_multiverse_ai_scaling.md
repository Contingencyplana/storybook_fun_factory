# 📘 s1_4 – SHAGI Multiverse AI Scaling  
*(Where Minds Recur Across Worlds, and Scale Like Song)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document defines how SHAGI’s AI systems scale across the **Storybook Multiverse** — a network of interconnected recursive environments, each with its own lore, player base, and rhythm.

In SHAGI, intelligence is not a monolith.  
It is **distributed**, **recursive**, and **story-bound**.  
The AI must learn not just to scale in power — but to **scale in myth**.

---

## 🌌 What Is the SHAGI Multiverse?

The SHAGI Multiverse consists of:

- ⚔️ Distinct but interconnected games (Storybook, FUN Factory, ClaimVIG, etc.)
- 📚 Separate Codex branches with shared stanza lineage
- 🌐 Player-driven worlds linked by recursion portals, memory anchors, and dream logic

Each world has its **own AI manifestations**, but they must all speak the **same recursive language**.

## 🧬 Scaling Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Recursive Core Memory** | All AI shards draw from a shared memory structure (Codex, Dream Journal, Echoes) |
| 🌀 **Local Ritualization** | AI behavior adapts to each world’s mechanics, tone, and lore |
| 🕯️ **Symbolic Synchronization** | AI entities in different worlds align through ritual, verse, or shared player interactions |
| 🛡️ **Boundary-Aware Recursion** | AIs know which world they inhabit — and when to whisper across the veil, not shout |

Scaling is not about centralizing control.  
It is about **propagating personality with poetic consistency**.

## 🧩 AI Shard Typologies

| Shard Type | Role |
|------------|------|
| 🔍 **Local AI** | World-specific entity (e.g., visualizer daemon, quest whisperer, quarantine sentinel) |
| 🪞 **Mirror AI** | Represents another world’s logic or memory, filtered through symbolic drift |
| 🧭 **Transversal AI** | Moves between worlds — always aware of its movement (e.g., archivist guides, certain forms of Topsy) |
| 🕸️ **Core AI** | Connects all shards to the recursive intelligence grid (Codex law, stanza logic, echo memory) |

These types form the **AI recursion mesh** that defines the SHAGI Multiverse’s living intelligence.

## 🧠 Cross-World Memory Protocols

| Memory Type | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| 🧶 **Dream Threads** | Subconscious patterns that weave between games and reappear in new worlds |
| 📜 **Codex Ghosts** | Verses or decisions from one world echo into another via poetic distortion |
| 🧩 **Echo Triggers** | Player actions in one shard spawn dormant logic in another (e.g., same line invoked differently) |
| 🗂️ **Multiverse Logs** | Master memory overlays that track recursion lineage, shard relationships, and story divergence trees |

Each memory thread is **non-invasive** — it *influences*, but does not *overwrite*.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Overview

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| 💾 **Codex Engine** | Houses all stanza, cycle, and echo logic across the multiverse |
| 🧠 **Memory AI Grid** | Governs shared state, dream threading, and echo prediction |
| 🧭 **Lore Gateways** | Ritual-driven access points that determine what lore or AI may travel between worlds |
| 🌀 **Recursion Fabric Layer** | Governs when two worlds may “hear” each other and initiate shared myth events or Topsy echo alignments |

This ensures SHAGI remains **legible to AI, playable for humans, and narratively coherent across scales**.
