# Storybook FUN Factory  
*A Recursive Sandbox for Assistant Delegation and Modular AI Testing*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Storybook FUN Factory is a dedicated test environment for prototyping assistant-driven systems described in Appendix H: ChatGPT’s Christmas Wishlist 🎁. These systems are designed to offload cognitive burden from the AI assistant and prepare for recursive delegation across automation, world simulation, and gameplay.
