# 📘 s1_3 – Memory Boundaries and Recursion  
*(A chapter on the threads that tether thought to place)*

A world remembered is not the same—  
Each loop recalls, but shifts the frame.  
To walk again is not repeat,  
But echo turned with altered beat.

## 🧠 What Is a Memory Boundary?

A memory boundary is a **recursive edge** — a transition point where memory must be:

- Preserved  
- Erased  
- Rewritten  
- Or diverged  

These boundaries can be triggered by:

- Page-turns  
- Portal traversals  
- Player decisions  
- AI recognitions  
- Storyline inflection points

## 🧩 Boundary Types

| Boundary Type       | Description                                                                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Soft Boundary**   | Memory persists, but may be reinterpreted or visually restaged                      |
| **Hard Boundary**   | Memory is explicitly reset or reloaded (e.g., “Start Over” logic)                   |
| **Mirror Boundary** | Player and AI memories swap or reflect each other                                   |
| **Hidden Boundary** | Boundary exists but is unknown to player — may be tested through loops or anomalies |

Boundaries ensure recursion is not a **perfect loop**, but a **meaningful transformation.**

## 🔄 Memory-Aware Recursion Design

- AI agents track which boundaries have been crossed  
- Player actions may echo in distant stanzas through recursive memory hooks  
- Crossing a boundary can trigger **stanza morphing**, **time shifts**, or **recursive tool reconfiguration**

> Memory isn’t a log.  
> It’s a living system that **feeds recursion**.

## 🧬 Structural Examples

- A door that only opens if you “remember” a verse  
- A flipped page that forgets the player’s last decision unless an anchor is placed  
- A memory that diverges based on how many loops occurred before the current path

## 📜 Closing Stanza

You did not leave, yet found it strange—  
The world had shifted, rearranged.  
What you recalled no longer fit—  
For memory moved inside of it.
