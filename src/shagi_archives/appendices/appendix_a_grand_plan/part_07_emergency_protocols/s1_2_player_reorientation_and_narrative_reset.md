# 📘 s1_2 – Player Reorientation and Narrative Reset  
*(A stanza for finding one’s way when the tale is lost)*

If path dissolves and pages blur,  
The story sends a whispered stir.  
A rhyme, a face, a flickered light—  
To turn the player back to right.

## 🧭 What Is Player Reorientation?

When recursion deepens or logic frays, players may:

- Become disoriented in narrative or space  
- Miss key triggers, quests, or transitions  
- Lose emotional or cognitive momentum  

**Player reorientation** is the process of gently returning the player to alignment—*without ever revealing the system beneath.*

## 🔄 Narrative Reset Mechanisms

| Mechanism Type         | Description                                                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ghost Guides**       | Characters who appear when a player is lost—offering hints or symbolic prompts. |
| **Memory Milestones**  | Interactive objects or stanzas that replay poetic memories or past decisions.   |
| **Page Echos**         | Environmental cues that reinforce lost direction (e.g., audio, color, flicker). |
| **Dream Sequences**    | Temporary detours that reintroduce narrative goals through symbolic experience. |

## 📚 Recursive Narrative Checkpoints

Instead of hard saves, Storybook uses **“recursive narrative checkpoints”**:

- Each major decision embeds a subtle, invisible anchor  
- These anchors allow flexible return points via lore triggers  
- No UI is shown—only myth, metaphor, or hallucination  

This maintains immersion while still offering recovery.

## 💠 Adaptive AI Guidance

AI Zones and companions may respond to lost players with:

- Altered speech rhythms  
- Restated goals in poetic form  
- Sudden shifts in tone, music, or illustrated behavior  

This ensures AI remains diegetic while helping players re-sync.

📜 *A tale once dropped need not be done—  
The verse can weave a second run.  
Not by command, or map, or cheat—  
But myth reborn beneath your feet.*
