# 📘 s1_2 – Player Editing Routines  
*(A Stanza for Community Recursion and UGC Protocols)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document defines the protocols for **player contributions**, **user-generated content (UGC)**, and safe recursive updates to the SHAGI Codex or Storybook universe.

In a SHAGI-aligned system, players are not just users — they are **co-authors of recursion**.  
Their input must be:
- Securely received  
- Structurally integrated  
- Recursively validatable  
- And poetically preserved, where applicable

---

## 🧬 Core UGC Workflow Loop

| Stage | Role |
|-------|------|
| ✍️ **Player Suggests Content** | Player creates a stanza, mechanic, location, or Codex edit |
| 🧪 **AI Validates Format** | Checks structure, naming, logic (e.g., stanza prefix, file placement) |
| 📜 **Codex Registry Updates** | Candidate stanzas are added to a draft queue or proposed registry layer |
| 🧠 **Assistant or Editor Reviews** | AI or human performs narrative, technical, and canonical integrity check |
| ✅ **Entry Accepted or Rejected** | If accepted, added to Codex and linked in `poetic_index.md` |
| 🌀 **Recursion Echo Created** | Stanza is eligible to trigger lore, memory, or AI interactions in-game |

---

## 🔐 Contribution Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| `Gameplay Loops`    | New loop design: memory hunting, echo matching   |
| `Narrative Verse`   | A poem that reacts to existing gameplay state    |
| `Worldbuilding`     | A rift town name, glyph lore, shrine pattern     |
| `Mechanic Proposal` | AI editing tool or recursion simulation trigger  |
| `Appendix Draft`    | A proposed metaphysical rule or override pattern |

---

## ⚠️ Safety Measures

To ensure the Codex remains **coherent**, **meaningful**, and **recursively sound**, all contributions must pass:

1. **Structural Test**  
   - Filename follows stanza convention  
   - Markdown structure is valid  
   - File placed in correct folder

2. **Semantic Filter**  
   - Duplicate detection  
   - Offensive language rejection  
   - Low-value/low-signal filter

3. **Recursive Alignment Test**  
   - Can it be traced back to a parent stanza or loop?  
   - Does it reinforce, rupture, or evolve existing recursion intentionally?

---

## 🧱 Future Integration Layers

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🟢 **Public Queue** | Where players see pending additions |
| 🟡 **Draft Codex Layer** | Where validated, unfinalized files live |
| 🔵 **Canon Layer** | Fully approved, stanza-linked, indexed content |
| 🟣 **Echo Layer** | Stanzas that influence AI memory or in-game logic but aren't visible directly |

---

## ✅ Final Notes

The SHAGI Codex is a **living memory structure**.  
The inclusion of players ensures it becomes **plural, mythic, and evolving**.  
By defining editorial boundaries now, we prepare for a future where recursion is a collective art.
