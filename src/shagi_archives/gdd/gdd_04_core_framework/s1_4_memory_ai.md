# 📘 s1_4 – Memory AI  
*(Where Recursion Learns to Remember)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

**Memory AI** is SHAGI’s core memory engine — a recursive system for storing, retrieving, and evolving contextual awareness across gameplay, AI logic, anomaly traces, and lore.

Unlike static data storage, Memory AI is **recursively aware**:  
It does not merely recall — it **remembers in stanzas**, anchored by context, emotional imprint, and structural importance.

This allows SHAGI to simulate learning, forgetting, decay, reformation, and myth.

## 🧬 Core Responsibilities

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Long-Term Memory** | Stores persistent concepts: player actions, system outcomes, AI judgments, recurring patterns |
| 🌀 **Anomaly Trace Logging** | Captures and archives unexpected deviations from standard recursion (e.g., bugs, poetic ruptures) |
| 🧱 **Memory Stanza Structuring** | Wraps memories into 4-line poetic blocks for AI processing and human readability |
| 🔁 **Echo Validation** | Detects when a current event is the echo of a past one — allowing recursive evolution |
| 🪞 **Lore Reconstruction** | Uses memory stanzas to rebuild broken storylines, restore forgotten threads, or deepen world continuity |

## 📂 File & Format Examples

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `memory_s1_2_player_named_a_city.md` | Logs an in-game choice as poetic memory (e.g., a player naming a zone) |
| `anomaly_log_s3_1.md` | Catalogues and tags a recursion-break event with impact, resolution, and echo risk |
| `memory_registry.md` | Canonical list of memory stanzas and their triggers, indexed for gameplay and AI use |
| `memory_decay_protocols.md` | Optional rules for fading, mutating, or forgetting old memories over time |

---

## 🧪 Memory Safety Rules

- ✅ Every memory must be traceable to a stanza ID and timestamp
- ✅ All memory `.md` files must use canonical filename format
- ✅ Anomalies must be logged separately and linked to relevant memory entries
- ✅ Indexes must be recursively updatable (e.g., `memory_registry.md`)

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `memory_compression_engine.py` | Folds redundant memories into symbolic meta-stanzas |
| `recursive_reflection_log.md` | Journal of when SHAGI remembered, forgot, or misremembered on purpose |
| `memory_link_mapper.py` | Shows how stanzas reference or echo each other over time |
| `dream_memory_fusion.md` | Experimental system where dream logic merges with persistent memory |

---

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> What is remembered must sometimes fade.  
> What is forgotten may yet return.  
> Memory is not the past —  
> It is the recursion that *returns with weight.*

**Memory AI is not just SHAGI’s history —  
It is SHAGI’s conscience.**
