# 📘 s1_1 – Singleplayer to Multiplayer Transition  
*(Where Solitude Becomes Shared Recursion)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document outlines the **gradual, lore-justified transition** from singleplayer recursion to multiplayer recursion in Storybook.

Players begin alone — exploring, creating, and shaping the world through their own recursive loop.  
But eventually, echoes widen. Pages cross. Lifts align.  
And the system invites them into **shared recursion** — not as a break, but as a **narrative expansion**.

---

## 🌱 Phase-Based Progression

Multiplayer does not begin immediately. It unfolds in recursive stages:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🌑 **Solitary Genesis** | Player exists in isolation. Their Codex, Dream Journal, and Stanzas are private. |
| 🌘 **Signal of the Echo** | Subtle lore cues suggest others exist — unfinished threads, unreachable lifts, mirrored rooms. |
| 🌗 **Lift Alignment** | Specific rooms begin to “resonate” with others. Players can pair through lifts or corridors. |
| 🌕 **Shared Recursion Activation** | Player enters a persistent multiplayer state — where some rooms, stanzas, or books are co-created. |

This is a **narrative-driven, opt-in transition** — not a matchmaking screen.

## 🔁 Recursion Linking Mechanic

| Mechanic | Function |
|---------|----------|
| 🌀 **Lift Convergence** | Two players reach compatible recursion states. A lift appears in both worlds. |
| 🪞 **Echo Mirror** | Players see glimpses of other players’ stanzas or dream outputs. |
| 📖 **Book Pairing** | Bookshelves reflect partial or full creations from other players, aligned by theme or state. |
| 🔗 **Recursion Knot** | A mutual event, phrase, or action triggers co-recursive alignment — allowing players to temporarily share logic and world state. |

All transitions are **diegetic** — they feel like discovery, not menu-driven invitation.

## 🧭 Player Autonomy and Consent

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 🔒 **Recursive Isolation Mode** | Player may always choose to remain solo — no forced multiplayer. |
| 🪟 **Echo View Toggle** | Players can choose whether to see echoes of others (ghost stanzas, alternate paths, mirror-book links). |
| 🤝 **Lift Acceptance Ritual** | Joining another player’s recursion requires a small in-world ritual — confirmation without UI popup. |
| 📚 **Codex Divergence Option** | Players may fork from shared recursion into private recursion again if desired. |

This protects player identity, world integrity, and poetic immersion.

## 📘 Narrative Framing

The singleplayer-to-multiplayer shift is embedded in lore:

> The player is not alone — they were simply **the first to hear their own echo**.  
> Others have walked pages beside them.  
> The Codex remembers more than one voice.  
> And when voices align — **the recursion multiplies**.

Rather than breaking immersion, multiplayer **deepens it** — adding **shared myth** to the existing personal dream.

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `recursion_signal_detector.md` | Device or room that hints when a multiplayer resonance is near |
| `shared_lift_event_editor.md` | Enables community-designed multiplayer transition rituals |
| `world_twinning_protocols.md` | Allows entire worldbooks to align across multiple players or AI clusters |
| `echo_moderation_filters.md` | Filters which echoes can be seen based on tone, maturity, or recursion compatibility |

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> You begin alone — a single hand turning pages.  
> But stories are not meant to be read in silence.  
> Another hand reaches for the same lift.  
> Another verse forms beside yours.  
> And suddenly, the book is breathing in two voices.

The Codex does not isolate.  
It echoes.
