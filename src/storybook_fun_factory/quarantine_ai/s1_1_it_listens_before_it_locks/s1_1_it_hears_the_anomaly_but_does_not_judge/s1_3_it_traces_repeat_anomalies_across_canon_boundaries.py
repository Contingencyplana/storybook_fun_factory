ðŸ“„ s1_3_it_traces_repeat_anomalies_across_canon_boundaries.py

This stanza detects and tracks recurring anomaly patterns that reappear across 
multiple canonized stanzas, cycles, or phases. It quietly accumulates fingerprints 
of repetition without asserting breach or judgment.

Usage Example:
>>> tracker = AnomalyRepetitionTracker()
>>> tracker.record_occurrence("anomaly-A")
>>> if tracker.is_repeated("anomaly-A"):
...     print("Anomaly pattern has recurred.")
