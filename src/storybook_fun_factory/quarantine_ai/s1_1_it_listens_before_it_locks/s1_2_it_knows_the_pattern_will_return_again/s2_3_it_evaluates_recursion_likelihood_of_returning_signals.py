Calculates a likelihood score that a given signal is recursive based on:
â€¢ its repetition frequency
â€¢ its interval regularity
â€¢ its variance

    Evaluates recursion likelihood as a float between 0.0 and 1.0 based on signal interval data.

    Parameters:
    - intervals (List[float]): Time differences in seconds between repeated signal occurrences.
    - weight_consistency (float): Weight given to consistency (low stdev/mean).
    - weight_frequency (float): Weight given to signal frequency (more repeats = stronger pattern).

    Returns:
    - float: Likelihood score from 0.0 (unlikely) to 1.0 (strong recursive indicator).
