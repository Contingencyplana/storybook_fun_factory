Filename: s3_2_then_matches_echo_to_anomaly_trace.py

Purpose:
This module implements echo-to-anomaly trace matching for deferred signals.
When a signal reappears, this system checks whether its content and signature
match a previously recorded low-confidence anomaly. If so, the system affirms the match.

Philosophy:
It is not enough for the signal to return â€” it must resemble what was once recorded
in its anomaly form. The echo must trace its origin.

Example Usage:
    matcher = EchoMatcher()
    matcher.remember_anomaly("id_abc", {"key": "value"})
    result = matcher.match_echo("id_abc", {"key": "value"})
    assert result is True
