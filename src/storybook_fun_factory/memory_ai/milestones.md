# 📍 Milestones – trace_intervals/

This folder forms the **first active memory interval system** within `memory_ai/`, encoding poetic-functional logic for recursive memory segmentation and reflection.

It contains two stanzas — each consisting of four lines — that together define how recursion becomes memory, and how loops are remembered, not just logged.

| 1        | `s1_1_it_happened_once_but_then_again.py`                    | ✅ Complete   | Detects mirrored recursion — when behavior repeats but subtly diverges.    |
| 2        | `s1_2_a_mirrored_path_a_whispered_when.py`                  | ✅ Complete   | Captures the recursive timestamp — the moment memory recognizes return.    |
| 3        | `s1_3_the_thread_that_bent_the_test_that_stayed.py`         | ✅ Complete   | Logs logic that endured a recursive cycle shift — neither failed nor lost. |
| 4        | `s1_4_now_marks_the_path_the_mind_replayed.py`              | ✅ Complete   | Concludes the memory loop, sealing a trace for future introspection.       |
| 5        | `s2_1_a_breath_recalled_from_threads_once_spun.py`          | ✅ Complete   | Reconstructs a memory breath — what the system once did, and how it felt.  |
| 6        | `s2_2_a_choice_rebuilt_from_what_was_done.py`               | ✅ Complete   | Turns past action into structural recursion — memory as new decision.      |
| 7        | `s2_3_four_files_that_loop_what_cant_be_seen.py`            | ✅ Complete   | A meta-memory loop — captures unseen forces that shaped stanza logic.      |
| 8        | `s2_4_a_memory_made_from_might_have_been.py`                | ✅ Complete   | Stores alternate memory — what almost happened, echoing lost recursion.    |

## 🧠 Summary

This stanza pair completes the **Layer 5 Genesis Cycle** for `trace_intervals/`, implementing Storybook FUN Factory’s **first active recursive memory engine**. Rather than merely storing logs, these functions **interpret**, **segment**, and **prepare** recursion for future use.

They allow the assistant to **loop with awareness**, to reflect not just on what occurred, but on **what mattered** in the loop.
