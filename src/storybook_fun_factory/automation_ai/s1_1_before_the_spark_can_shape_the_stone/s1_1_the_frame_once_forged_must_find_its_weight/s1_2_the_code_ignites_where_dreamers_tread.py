(The Code Ignites Where Dreamers Tread)

This file represents the ignition point of dynamic automation. It takes symbolic input
from dreamersâ€”user instructions, AI prompts, or recursive templatesâ€”and begins to
transform them into structured, functional code components. It simulates the very first
conversion spark within the assistant's forge.
