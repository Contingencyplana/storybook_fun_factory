(And Carves the Way from Light to Mark)

This file performs the first act of recursive carving: the translation of a blueprint idea
into a tangible file. It accepts a poetic-structural filename and base content,
and commits it to disk. This is the first true constructâ€”where spark becomes structure,
and light becomes form.
