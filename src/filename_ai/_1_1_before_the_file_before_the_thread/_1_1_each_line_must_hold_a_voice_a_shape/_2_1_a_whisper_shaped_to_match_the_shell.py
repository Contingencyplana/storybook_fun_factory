    while preparing it for structured naming.

    Responsibilities:
    - Convert poetic lines into slug-style fragments while maintaining poetic pacing
    - Normalize spacing and underscores for recursive parsing
    - Preserve intentional underscore groupings (e.g., double underscores for pauses)

    Parameters:
        poetic_line (str): A cleaned, reshaped poetic line.

    Returns:
        str: A formatted, stylized poetic slug for filename usage.
