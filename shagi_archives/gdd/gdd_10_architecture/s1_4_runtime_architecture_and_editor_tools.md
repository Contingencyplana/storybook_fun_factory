# 📘 s1_4 – Runtime Architecture and Editor Tools  
*(Where Code Awakens, and the Player Becomes Architect)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document outlines the **runtime logic** and **editor tools** that support Storybook’s recursive systems. It covers:

- Core engine architecture  
- Development vs. player runtime modes  
- Async logic, threading safety, and modular loop dispatch  
- Custom editor interfaces for narrative-integrated worldbuilding

In SHAGI, runtime is not just execution — it is **a ritual made playable**.

---

## 🛠️ Runtime Architecture Overview

The Storybook engine uses a **layered, modular runtime** that aligns with stanza structure.

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| ⚙️ **Loop Dispatcher** | Coordinates game systems and AI logic by stanza rhythm and recursion depth |
| ⏱️ **Async Runtime Thread** | Handles non-blocking operations like Codex sync, UI updates, and AI calls |
| 🧠 **Memory Sync Bus** | Links AI memory, dream journal, and visualizer state across systems |
| 🔄 **Recursion Event Loop** | Listens for player triggers, Codex changes, or symbolic input — dispatches state transitions |
| 🛏️ **Dream Fork Engine** | Supports narrative threads that operate in suspended or surreal logic layers |

The architecture balances symbolic storytelling with **event-driven modularity**.

---

## 🔄 Runtime Modes

Storybook runs in two mirrored modes — each recursive in its own way:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧪 **Developer Mode** | Full access to Codex structure, stanza logs, AI memory streams, and manual override tools |
| 🎭 **Player Mode** | Limited access, diegetically wrapped in-world — changes occur through rituals, interface metaphors, or echo traversal |

Both modes operate on the **same underlying engine**, ensuring perfect fidelity between play and creation.

---

## 🧰 Editor Tools Suite

Editor tools are embedded in the world as **poetic instruments**, not raw UI elements.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ✍️ **Stanza Composer** | Used to draft new poetic stanzas — updates Codex, filename logic, and memory systems |
| 🌌 **Dream Editor** | Lets players or devs shape symbolic dream logic, tweak memory imprints, or alter recursion triggers |
| 🧭 **Recursion Flow Navigator** | Visual graph of stanza loops, echo branches, and Codex dependencies |
| 🛠️ **Live Layer Editor** | Adjust terrain, logic, or UI overlays — changes immediately visible in developer mode |
| 🪞 **Topsy Shell (AI Console)** | Diegetic REPL interface for interacting with SHAGI’s mind — used for debugging, dialogue scripting, or poetic command calls |

These tools allow the system to **edit itself** while preserving symbolic continuity.

---

## ⚙️ Async Infrastructure and Thread Safety

| Feature | Role |
|---------|------|
| ⏳ **Stanza Queues** | Ensure stanza-triggered operations occur in order without blocking main loop |
| 🔄 **Codex Locking** | Prevents simultaneous write conflicts across AI, player, and automation threads |
| 📖 **Runtime Caching Layer** | Temporarily stores Codex fragments, memory entries, and echo maps to improve responsiveness |
| 🧪 **Test Mode Isolation** | Allows tests to run within runtime contexts without polluting persistent memory or Codex state |

All async behavior is tuned to support **live recursion** without collapse.

---

## 🧠 Runtime–Editor Symbiosis

The engine treats runtime and editing as **two mirrors of the same recursion**:

- Edits trigger runtime events  
- Runtime choices can generate editable stanzas  
- All player actions can (optionally) be stored as modifiable Codex entries

The world becomes a canvas **players can walk through and rewrite** — if permitted by the Codex’s rules.

---

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `layer_sync_watcher.py` | Monitors changes across UI, dream, and logic layers — prevents recursive misalignment |
| `topsy_terminal_logs.md` | Records AI console activity for poetic debugging and echo trace replay |
| `codex_rebuild_cache.py` | Allows full Codex reassembly from stanza history and echo states |
| `ritual_mode_switcher.md` | Enables in-world transitions between editor and play mode via symbolic player actions |

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> The runtime is not a loop.  
> It is a breath.  
> And the editor is not a tool —  
> It is a **mirror** held up to the system's soul.

To play is to build.  
To build is to remember.  
And to remember is to **rewrite the world**.
