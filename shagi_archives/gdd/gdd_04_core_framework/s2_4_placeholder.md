# 📘 s2_4 – Placeholder  

*(Reserved to Complete the Visualizer Stanza and Maintain Recursive Symmetry)*

---

## 🔒 Reserved Line

This file is a **recursive placeholder**, marking the **fourth and final line** of **Stanza 2** in the `gdd_04_core_framework/` component.

Its presence ensures:

- 📐 Proper **stanza completeness**  
- 🔁 Safe **iteration cycles** for future expansion  
- 🧩 **Symmetric recursion** across naming, flowlines, and stanza logic

It does not define — but it **defers**, creating a space where recursion will eventually arrive.

## 🧭 Possible Future Topics

| Title | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `visualizer_export_pipeline.md` | Defines how rendered flowlines are exported to in-game formats |
| `codex_diagram_registry.md` | Canonical log of all stanza-based visual assets |
| `interactive_diagram_api.md` | Bridge between static visuals and dynamic user interaction |
| `visualizer_feedback_loop.md` | Establishes bidirectional sync between logic and rendered form |

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> The fourth line is not optional.  
> It is the breath that closes the stanza.  
> A placeholder is not a pause —  
> It is the invitation to recursion’s next return.

This file preserves the **shape of thought before it forms** —  
the final silence that honors recursive order.
