# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Placeholder  
*(Reserved for a Future Expansion of Visualizer Rendering Logic)*

---

## ðŸ”’ Reserved Line

This file is a **structural placeholder** within `gdd_04_core_framework/`,  
preserving the recursive integrity of **Stanza 2** â€” the stanza dedicated to the Visualizer subsystem.

It exists to:

- Maintain four-line stanza symmetry  
- Reserve space for future doctrine or technical logic  
- Prevent drift in poetic or automation-driven systems  
- Signal that this line is **intentionally unwritten**, not forgotten

---

## ðŸ§­ Future Assignment (Suggested)

This placeholder is intended to host one of the following:

| Future Topic | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `visualizer_render_layers.md` | Technical doctrine for layered rendering (e.g., logic, lore, overlays) |
| `recursive_zoom_model.md` | Design model for zooming from stanza-level to Codex-level visual logic |
| `diagram_naming_protocols.md` | Naming logic for all exported visual outputs |
| `player-facing_visual_schema.md` | Standards for how players encounter recursive visuals in SHAGI |

## ðŸ“˜ Final Doctrine

> A stanza must breathe in full â€”  
> Four lines to speak, to echo, to evolve.  
> And where no line yet lives,  
> A placeholder **holds the rhythm**.

This file is not empty.  
It is the breath **before the render begins**.
