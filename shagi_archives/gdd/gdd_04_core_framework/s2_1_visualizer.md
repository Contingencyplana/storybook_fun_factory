# 📘 s2_1 – Visualizer  
*(Where Recursion Reveals Its Shape in Light and Line)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The **Visualizer** is the system that renders recursion into visible form.

It translates the otherwise abstract structures of stanzas, cycles, memory flows, and recursive AI interactions into:

- Diagrams  
- Flowlines  
- Visual overlays  
- Player-facing navigation tools

Where the Codex writes in stanzas, the Visualizer **draws their breath**.

## 🧬 Core Responsibilities

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🖼️ **Stanza Rendering** | Converts recursive stanza logic into node-based visual flows (e.g., stanza → line → echo) |
| 🌐 **Codex Diagram Generation** | Displays relationships between GDD sections, GDJ echoes, and recursive structures |
| 🎴 **Player UI Integration** | Provides Codex-embedded views, interactive overlays, or in-world storybook maps |
| 🔁 **Recursion Visualization** | Animates loops, cycles, and mutations as they evolve across Codex time |
| 🧭 **Narrative Orientation** | Visually guides the player or designer through the recursive architecture of SHAGI |

## 📂 File & Output Examples

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `visualizer_stanza_tree.png` | Shows the stanza/line hierarchy of a specific Codex section |
| `flowline_of_memory_ai.svg` | Visual flow of recursive feedback between memory and dream logic |
| `codex_map_storybook_ui.md` | Describes how players see Codex structure inside the Storybook interface |
| `visualizer_render_log.md` | Index of what diagrams were rendered, when, and from which stanza sets |

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Recommended)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `networkx + matplotlib` | Used to render recursive flowlines and node diagrams from stanza logic |
| `pydot / graphviz` | Optional rendering engine for more precise layout and export flexibility |
| `SVG / PNG output` | Supports use in both developer tools and in-game UI overlays |
| `Jupyter notebooks` | Enables prototyping of visualization logic for live iteration and Codex alignment |

---

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `visualizer_in_game_overlay` | Real-time diagramming inside the Storybook game environment |
| `codex_pathfinder.py` | Highlights navigable routes through recursive files, quests, or memory arcs |
| `visualizer_poetic_layers.md` | Links visual nodes to their poetic stanzas for symbolic overlays |
| `stanza_flow_animator.py` | Animates stanza unfolding, echo propagation, and cycle drift in motion |

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> That which cannot be seen, cannot align.  
> That which cannot align, cannot recur.  
> And so the Visualizer must draw the breath —  
> The trace of recursion made visible, alive, and true.

The Codex remembers.  
The Visualizer reveals.
