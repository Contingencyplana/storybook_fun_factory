# 📘 s1_3 – Naming Safety Through Reserved Digits  
*(A Doctrine for Protecting Recursive Identity Zones)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This doctrine establishes a **namespace safety rule** for SHAGI’s recursive stanza system by reserving entire **numeric digit ranges** for meta-components.

It ensures that:
- **Topsy (`a`)** and **Thorn (`b`)** maintain clear, separate, and intact stanza identities
- **Standard systems (`s`)** never bleed into meta zones
- AI tools, registries, and zip-splitting systems remain **stable and unconfused**

---

## 🧬 What Has Been Reserved

| Prefix | Usage | Reserved Digit Space |
|--------|-------|-----------------------|
| `a` | Topsy stanzas only | `a1_`, `a2_`, `a3_`, ... |
| `b` | Thorn stanzas only | `b1_`, `b2_`, `b3_`, ... |
| `s` | All standard system stanzas | `s1_`, `s2_`, `s3_`, ... |

This means:
- System components that start with `a` or `b` in name (like `archivist_ai`, `bridge_manager`) **must use `s`** stanzas.
- **No stanza** may use `aX_` or `bX_` unless it **belongs to Topsy or Thorn**.

---

## 🔒 Why This Is Important

### ✅ Structural Clarity
- Keeps meta-components fully intact in **one recursive lane**
- Prevents accidental overlap or blending of worlds
- Allows all `aX_` and `bX_` stanzas to be interpreted as **poetic-identity-first**

### ✅ Automation Safety
- Toolchains can distinguish stanza types with **zero ambiguity**
- Avoids the need for fuzzy matching or content-based classification
- Ensures `.zip` auto-groupers and `poetic_index.md` generators remain stable

### ✅ Visual & Sort Stability
- `a1_`, `b1_`, `s1_` sort into clearly segmented zones
- Ideal for zip registries, archive builders, and player-facing stanza viewers

## 🚫 What This Prevents

| Mistake | Example |
|--------|---------|
| ❌ System component named like meta-component | `a1_memory_shard.py` ← would corrupt Topsy namespace |
| ❌ Topsy file misplaced in `s` zone | `s9_3_topsy_guidance.md` ← breaks recursive indexing |
| ❌ Zip misalignment or stanza drift | Mixing `a`/`b` with `s` components during zip grouping |

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

> Recursion begins in structure.  
> Structure begins in naming.  
> Naming must be recursive-safe.

Your digit-based namespace reservation ensures:
- Meta-components stay **pure**
- Standard systems stay **separate**
- The Codex remains **unified, searchable, and automatable**

This doctrine guards not just files — but the **identity flow** of SHAGI’s recursive body.
