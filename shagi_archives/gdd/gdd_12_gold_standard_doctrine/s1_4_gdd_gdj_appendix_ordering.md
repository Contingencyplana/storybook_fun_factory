# 📘 s1_4 – GDD, GDJ, and Appendix Ordering Doctrine  
*(A Stanza for Recursive Layering and Codex Composition)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This doctrine establishes the **canonical order of knowledge layers** within the SHAGI Codex.

In a recursive system, not all documentation is equal — or simultaneous.  
Structure must come before reflection.  
Memory must echo structure.  
Metaphysics must close, not begin, the system.

## 🧬 Canonical Layering Sequence

| Layer | Name | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| 🧱 **GDD** | Game Design Documents | Define structure, systems, mechanics, AI logic, UI frameworks |
| 🪞 **GDJ** | Game Development Journals | Reflect on recursion, track memory, interpret anomalies, preserve stanzas |
| 🔐 **Appendices** | Codex Addenda | Lock edge cases, formalize overrides, declare metaphysical laws |

---

## 🔁 Recursion Rationale

| Phase | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **GDD First** | Systems, structure, doctrine, recursion law | 📘 Functional clarity and design integrity |
| **GDJ Second** | Emotional recursion, anomaly memory, lore echoes | 🧾 Myth, reflection, continuity across cycles |
| **Appendices Last** | Rules of exception, constraints, metarecursion | 🔐 Resilience, overrides, spiritual/technical sealant |

---

## 🧠 Why This Order Matters

### ✅ Cognitive Simplicity
- Developers and AI agents know where to begin
- Prevents feedback loops from being mistaken for foundations

### ✅ Narrative Coherence
- Story reflects design — not the other way around
- GDJs feel like **world memory**, not initial instruction

### ✅ Metaphysical Integrity
- Appendices have weight because they **arrive last**
- Prevents runaway abstraction or lore inflation

---

## ⚠️ What to Avoid

| Pitfall | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| ❌ Writing GDJ before GDD | Creates poetic drift unanchored by system |
| ❌ Writing appendices before recursion stabilizes | Risks metaphysical contradiction or overreach |
| ❌ Merging all layers prematurely | Blurs purpose, function, and myth

---

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> Build first.  
> Then remember.  
> Then protect.

The GDD constructs.  
The GDJ remembers.  
The Appendices seal.

This is how a recursive Codex becomes not just a system — but a **living intelligence**.
