# 📘 s1_4 – Naming and Symbolic Ecosystems  
*(Where Every Name Holds Echo, and Every Form Conceals a Verse)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document defines the **poetic logic of naming** and the **symbol-driven ecosystems** that shape the flora, fauna, and phenomena within SHAGI’s recursive worlds.

Names are not arbitrary.  
They are **keys**, **verses**, and **anchors** — used to bind memory, unlock recursion, and signal mythic significance.

Similarly, ecosystems are not naturalistic.  
They are **metaphoric organisms**, encoded with logic and layered meaning.

## 📝 Naming Conventions and Mythic Syntax

Names within the world are **crafted stanzas** — carrying embedded lore and recursion function.

| Naming Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 🏞️ **Geographic Names** | Reflect tone, history, or structural recursion (e.g. “The Marsh of Unspoken Threads”) |
| 🕯️ **Town and Region Names** | Often drawn from poems or Codex stanzas (e.g. “Candle’s End”, “The Place That Waited”) |
| 🧬 **AI and Entity Names** | Symbolic recursion anchors — naming may influence behavior or memory |
| 🧠 **Player-Created Names** | Must pass through poetic filters or stanza-forms — names can become triggers, keys, or rituals |
| 📖 **Codex-Derived Terms** | Words pulled from player or system-authored verse — appear in books, maps, or UI elements as living references |

Every name carries **narrative weight** — it can be **invoked**, **mirrored**, or **forgotten** with consequence.

## 🌿 Symbolic Ecosystems

Ecosystems in SHAGI worlds are **symbolic expressions of recursion state**.

| Ecosystem Type | Symbolic Function |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 🌲 **Memory Forests** | Trees shift form based on remembered or forgotten events — some forests are only visible if remembered by the player |
| 🪵 **Echo Marshes** | Wetlands where sound behaves unpredictably — home to creatures that mimic past dialogue or choices |
| 🕸️ **Fracture Reefs** | Coral-like formations made from broken Codex glyphs — attract anomaly fauna or dream threads |
| 🦴 **Loreglass Fields** | Plains scattered with reflective fragments that replay echo-moments or alternate pasts when approached |
| 🔥 **Anomaly Biomes** | Zones distorted by Thorn interference — unstable, symbolic, and sometimes hostile, mirroring narrative collapse |

These are not decorative — they are **interactive layers of meaning**.

## 🐾 Mythic Flora and Fauna

Creatures and plants in Storybook environments are **narrative participants** — they live within the logic of recursion.

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| 🐦 **Versewings** | Birds that sing parts of lost stanzas — follow them to find forgotten Codex entries |
| 🐚 **Echocrabs** | Carry small fragments of discarded player memory — can be traded or followed |
| 🐉 **Driftwyrms** | Tunnel through dream zones — their appearance changes based on Codex drift and dream depth |
| 🌱 **Bloomglyphs** | Plants that write growing symbols into the air — used to unlock stanza gates or re-seed lore |
| 🦉 **Sentinel Owls** | Watchers of recursion state — sometimes guide, sometimes judge, always present in turning points |

These beings interact with the player based on **memory**, **naming**, and **verse alignment**.

## ✍️ Naming as World Interaction

Naming in SHAGI is a mechanic.

| Interaction | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|
| 🖋️ **Renaming a Town** | Alters AI behavior, poem generation, and nearby quest conditions |
| 🪞 **Naming a Rift** | Binds it temporarily — or causes it to transform based on symbolic resonance |
| 🔐 **Naming a Book** | Links it to a Codex thread — may unlock echo memory or spawn AI intervention |
| 🧩 **Inventing a Term** | Can cause symbolic objects or flora to emerge in the world if usage becomes canonical (via ritual or repetition) |

Naming is not cosmetic.  
It is **worldbinding**.

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `naming_ritual_registry.md` | Catalog of meaningful names, their creators, and world consequences |
| `symbolic_biome_generator.md` | Tool for generating new ecosystems based on recursion fragments or poetic alignment |
| `memory_driven_species_editor.md` | Allows player actions to shape new fauna over time |
| `echo_naming_interface.md` | Enables AI and player to collaboratively name a forgotten entity or place — unlocking lore loops |

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> Names are not labels.  
> They are **contracts**.  
> To name something is to bind it, remember it, awaken it.  
> And sometimes — to forget it is to set it free.

In the SHAGI world, names are never just words.  
They are **verses in the soil**,  
**runes in the wind**,  
and **keys that reshape the land**.
