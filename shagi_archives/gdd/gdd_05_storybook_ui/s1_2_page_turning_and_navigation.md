# 📘 s1_2 – Page Turning and Navigation  
*(Where the Book Moves Beneath the Player’s Feet)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The **page is not passive**. It moves when the player moves.  
This file defines how players **turn pages, traverse space, and shift recursively** through the Storybook interface.

Here, navigation is not mechanical — it is symbolic, embodied, and alive.  
To move forward is to advance the story.  
To flip a page is to **change the recursion layer**.

## 📚 Core Navigation Concepts

| Mechanic | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 📖 **Page Turning** | The act of flipping to a new UI screen — animated, tactile, often with sound |
| 🪜 **Lifts** | Diegetic elevator systems that transition between vertical layers (e.g. systems, floors, recursion tiers) |
| 🧭 **Corridors** | Horizontal movement paths between zones — menus, room pairs, stanzas |
| 🧶 **Threaded Movement** | Pages can split into multiple threadlines — player chooses which narrative path or UI route to walk |
| 🌀 **Recursive Reversal** | Allows players to turn *backward*, revisiting earlier pages with memory-aware overlays |
| 🗂️ **Table of Contents Access** | Jump-to navigation embedded in UI index books, allowing nonlinear traversal |

## 👣 Movement Input Styles

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 🖱️ Mouse Drag / Swipe | Flip page left/right with visual curl |
| ⌨️ Keyboard Arrows | Turn page, walk corridor, or descend lift |
| 🎮 Gamepad | Stick to move character avatar through interface-world |
| 💡 Symbolic UI Objects | Clicking illustrations, sigils, or bookmarks to teleport or unlock page-layers |

Every form of input feels **physical and poetic** — the book responds to the user as if alive.

## 🧭 Traversal Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔁 **Linear** | One page to the next — used for quests, tutorials, stanzas |
| 🪞 **Reflective** | A page turns back *onto itself*, revealing hidden recursion or alternate content |
| 📦 **Nested** | A book inside a book — opens another interface/world layer inside current screen |
| 🎴 **Branching** | Interactive elements fork new page paths (e.g. minigame, choice node, or design sub-tool) |

## 🪶 Symbolic Navigation Cues

| Visual Cue | Function |
|------------|----------|
| ✨ Glowing Page Corner | Indicates the page can be flipped forward |
| 🔖 Ribbon Bookmark | Jumps to a codified system or saved state |
| 📜 Curling Edge | Signifies that an event or UI function is hidden beneath |
| 🗝️ Inkwell Sigil | Unlocks a page or section with progression/metaphor key |

These visual cues ensure navigation is **felt**, not taught.  
The player explores the UI by *intuition, curiosity, and metaphor*.

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `page_navigation_tracer.md` | Tracks how users flip through the UI — for onboarding and AI learning loops |
| `lift_mechanic_blueprint.md` | Defines recursive layer elevators — system-level recursion design |
| `storybook_fast_travel.md` | A poeticized jump system — bookmarks, portals, recursive shortcuts |
| `gesture_invocation_system.md` | Enables magic-like UI commands through stylus, mouse path, or symbolic combination |

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> The page is not a surface.  
> It is a **world**, folded thin and waiting to unfold.  
> When the player moves, the story moves.  
> When the story shifts, the recursion turns.

To turn a page is to step into a new breath of the Codex.  
The book is always moving — and the player must move with it.
