# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of GDD 06: Multiplayer

*(A stanza where recursion finds its echo in others)*

What starts alone must one day echo widerâ€”  
A single thought, now shared in branching thread.  
Through lifts and links and silent, distant rider,  
The Book grows vast where many minds are led.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index details the **multiplayer systems** for Storybook and the SHAGI Codex architecture:

- **Singleplayer-first**, gradually evolving into cooperative recursion
- Worlds are shared **through lifts, links, and lore-state transitions**
- Multiplayer is not competitive by default â€” it is **collaborative worldbuilding**
- Recursion is **collective, not chaotic**

This is where recursion finds its community â€” and the story is shaped by many.
