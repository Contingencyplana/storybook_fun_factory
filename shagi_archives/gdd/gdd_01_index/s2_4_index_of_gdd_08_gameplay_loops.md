# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of GDD 08: Gameplay Loops

*(A stanza where systems breathe and players return)*

No tale survives that does not turn againâ€”  
A rhythm etched in challenge, joy, and play.  
Each loop returns not just to where it's been,  
But builds a deeper world along the way.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index outlines the **core gameplay loops** that drive player experience within Storybook and SHAGI-integrated games:

- Loops are **not grind** â€” they are **recursions with meaning**
- Every loop teaches, rewards, and evolves the player
- AI, narrative, and world progression are **intertwined through action**

These are the playerâ€™s rituals â€” from discovery to mastery.
