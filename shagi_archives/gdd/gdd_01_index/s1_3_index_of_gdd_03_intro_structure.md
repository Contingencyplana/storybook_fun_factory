# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of GDD 03: Intro Structure

*(A stanza to mark the Codex's first foundation stones)*

Before the systems stir and pathways split,  
A shape must formâ€”unseen, but deeply laid.  
Not function first, but how all forms commit  
To weave their roles within what thought has made.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index gathers all introductory structural doctrines that define:

- How the SHAGI Codex is **organized**
- What recursion **means** in this context
- How poetic stanzas map to **technical intent**
- The **naming systems**, stanza layouts, and recursive logic that shape every file

This is the **first scaffolding**â€”the logic of stanzas before their purpose is filled.
