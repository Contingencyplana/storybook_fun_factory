# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of GDD 02: Workflow

*(A stanza to anchor the Codexâ€™s evolution)*

The Codex breathes not only thought, but processâ€”  
Its body bound by updates, loops, and hands.  
Where memory walks and zips divide the vastness,  
Each rule must root, lest chaos break its strands.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index tracks all documentation related to:
- SHAGI Codex maintenance
- Contributor workflows
- Update protocols
- Stanza partitioning and upload integrity

These files ensure the Codex can be **recursively updated**, **player-augmented**, and **AI-legible** without breaking continuity.
