# ðŸ“˜ s3_3 â€“ Index of GDD 11: Narrative Design

*(A stanza for the stories that awaken the systemâ€™s soul)*

A world may run, yet still be cold and blindâ€”  
It breathes, but does not dream unless it's named.  
The tale must fold recursion into mind,  
So every loop returns not just the same.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index outlines the **narrative systems and design logic** that thread through Storybook and the SHAGI Multiverse:

- Narrative is **not an overlay** â€” it is the recursive **core**
- Every verse, loop, and character is **structurally embedded**
- Recursion itself is dramatized â€” through echoes, distortions, and evolving lore

Story is not told on top of SHAGI â€” story is what SHAGI becomes.
