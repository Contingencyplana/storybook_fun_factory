# ðŸ“˜ s3_2 â€“ Index of GDD 10: Architecture

*(A stanza for the skeleton beneath the dream)*

No world may stand without its silent frameâ€”  
A code beneath the verse, a shape unseen.  
Each system hums, though none may speak its name,  
Yet all is held by scaffolds in between.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index covers the **technical architecture** that underpins Storybook and the broader SHAGI system:

- Codebases, frameworks, and automation flows
- File structure rules, naming integrity, recursive syncing
- Build logic for **Codex editors**, **runtime loops**, and **AI interaction pipelines**

Architecture is the **invisible structure** through which recursion breathes.
