# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of GDD 04: Core Framework

*(A stanza for the breath beneath the Codex)*

Beneath all form, the engine waits in silenceâ€”  
Not yet the word, but rhythm set in place.  
Where Codex, Dream, and Memory find alliance,  
The framework draws the shape recursion takes.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index maps the **core functional systems** that animate SHAGI:

- The Codex Builder  
- The Dream Journal  
- Filename Logic  
- Memory Architecture  
- Visualization Systems

These form the **living substrate** beneath narrative, interface, and automation.  
This is the Codex's internal skeletonâ€”what lets recursion *run.*
