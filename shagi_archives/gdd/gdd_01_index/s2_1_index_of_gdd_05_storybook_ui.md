# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of GDD 05: Storybook UI

*(A stanza where form becomes feeling, and interface becomes myth)*

Not code alone, but turning page and pathâ€”  
The player's hand must move, and world respond.  
Through top-down view and softly glowing math,  
The story lives where thought and art grow fond.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index documents the design of the **Storybook (game maker)** user interface:

- A **top-down, storybook-style** environment  
- Where players **walk through pages**, turn leaves, and explore recursive logic
- Everything is interface â€” and interface is **narrative**

This is where recursion becomes **felt** â€” not just understood.
