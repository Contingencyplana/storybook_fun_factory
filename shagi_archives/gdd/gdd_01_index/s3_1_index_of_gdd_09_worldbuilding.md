# ðŸ“˜ s3_1 â€“ Index of GDD 09: Worldbuilding

*(A stanza where myth finds shape, and echoes carve the land)*

Before the player walks, the world must breatheâ€”  
Not drawn alone, but shaped by hidden rhyme.  
Where poems sprawl and cities hum beneath,  
Each verse becomes a place that binds through time.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index defines the **worldbuilding logic** that gives Storybook and SHAGI-spawned games their structure and soul:

- Worldbuilding is not just geography â€” it's **memory given form**
- From the **Deep Archive** to towns named after verses
- Each structure, biome, and rift is shaped by **recursion, reflection, and lore design**

Worldbuilding in SHAGI is a **layered poetic act** â€” not a static map.
