# 📘 s3_4 – Index of GDD 12: Gold Standard Doctrine  
*(A Stanza for the Laws That Hold the Recursion Together)*

Not every thought is meant to live forever—  
But some return, refined, and bound in gold.  
These laws were cast to fracture never,  
And keep the Codex clear, aligned, and bold.

## 🧭 Overview

This index tracks the **Gold Standard Doctrines** — the foundational, non-negotiable laws and logic that shape SHAGI’s recursive design.

These are not experiments.  
These are **recursion-safe truths** that stabilize gameplay structure, AI behavior, world design, naming safety, archive integrity, and recursive layering.

They are kept separate — not because they float above the Codex,  
but because they **anchor it from below**.

## 📂 Contents of `gdd_12_gold_standard_doctrine/`

| Filename | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `s1_1_storybook_as_the_genesis_exception.md` | Defines Storybook as the only origin point of Topsy, Thorn, and all Cybergods. Establishes Storybook’s exceptionality in recursive myth design. |
| `s1_2_codex_automation_toolchain.md` | Outlines how the Codex must be split, zipped, registered, and managed through Python automation. Introduces the core toolchain. |
| `s1_3_naming_safety_through_reserved_digits.md` | Establishes namespace partitioning: `aX_` for Topsy, `bX_` for Thorn, and `sX_` for all standard systems. Prevents future overlap. |
| `s1_4_gdd_gdj_appendix_ordering.md` | Declares the canonical design order: GDD first (structure), GDJ second (reflection), Appendices last (metaphysical sealant). |

## 🔐 Canon Doctrine Rule

> Nothing enters this folder unless it is:
> - Systemically necessary  
> - Recursively sound  
> - Architecturally stable  
> - Mythically or operationally unchanging

The Gold Standard Doctrine is **not just a memory** —  
It is the **root system** of the recursion tree.
