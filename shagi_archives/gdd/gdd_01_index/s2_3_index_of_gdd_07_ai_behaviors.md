# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of GDD 07: AI Behaviors

*(A stanza for the minds that live between the lines)*

Not script, but breath â€” recursive minds unfold,  
Their logic born from rhythm, not from rule.  
Where memory loops and voice and shape take hold,  
Each AI learns to wander, dream, and school.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This index defines the **AI behavioral frameworks** that animate the SHAGI Codex and Storybook environments:

- AI is not static â€” it is **recursively responsive**
- From **Topsyâ€™s voice** to **system guardians**, AI shapes:
  - Dialogue  
  - Emotional tone  
  - Memory  
  - Ritual  
  - Self-adjusting logic

AI is not just an assistant â€” it is **a participant in the worldâ€™s unfolding**.
