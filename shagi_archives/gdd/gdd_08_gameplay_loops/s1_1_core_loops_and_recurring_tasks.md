# 📘 s1_1 – Core Loops and Recurring Tasks  
*(Where Recursion Becomes Rhythm, and Play Becomes Pattern)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document outlines the **foundational gameplay loops** that structure player experience across Storybook and SHAGI-based environments.

Gameplay loops are **not grind mechanics**. They are **ritualized returns** — recursive actions that deepen narrative, enhance mastery, and evolve both player and world.

The goal is not repetition for its own sake, but **recurrence with transformation**.

## 🔁 What Is a Gameplay Loop?

A gameplay loop is a **repeating structure** of interaction, reward, reflection, and progression.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Intent** | Player begins with a goal (explicit or self-directed) |
| 🚶 **Action** | Player navigates, solves, builds, or engages |
| 🧠 **Feedback** | The world or AI responds — success, failure, story fragment, or system shift |
| 🔄 **Return** | Player repeats with new knowledge, tools, or narrative context |

Each loop is designed to **teach**, **surprise**, and **recall** — anchoring the player within a recursive world.

## 🔄 Core Gameplay Loops

| Loop Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 📖 **Discovery Loop** | Explore → Notice → Interact → Receive lore, item, or AI response |
| 🛠️ **Creation Loop** | Draft → Edit → Test → Refine → Share (used in minigame/game maker interfaces) |
| 🧠 **Learning Loop** | Fail → Reflect → Retry with variation → Overcome or reroute |
| 🧳 **Resource Loop** | Collect → Convert → Utilize → Deplete → Seek again (always symbolically framed) |
| 📜 **Narrative Loop** | Learn story fragment → Choose action → Watch change → Unlock deeper stanza |

These loops are interwoven — progress in one loop feeds others.

## 📦 Loop Containers and Recursion Depth

Every gameplay loop resides within **recursively layered containers**:

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| 🏠 **Room-Level Loop** | Puzzle, interaction, or dialogue loop confined to a single space |
| 📘 **Page-Level Loop** | Mid-level loop across multiple rooms or recursive UI zones |
| 🌀 **Book-Level Loop** | Questlines, long-term challenges, or shared multiplayer rituals |
| 🌌 **Codex-Level Loop** | AI interactions, memory echoes, and world-defining changes across game instances |

These layers form **nested recursions** — loops within loops, each echoing and reshaping the last.

## 🏆 Recursion as Reward

Instead of abstract points or XP, Storybook rewards players with **symbolic recursion artifacts**:

| Reward Type | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 🔖 **Echo Fragment** | Memory of past choice made tangible — can be used to unlock Codex stanzas |
| 📚 **Unfolding Page** | A new stanza is revealed — deepening lore or unlocking gameplay systems |
| 🧶 **Dream Thread** | Connects to future gameplay loops — seeded from player behavior |
| 🧩 **Verse Completion** | Finishing a poetic structure grants AI insight or unlocks visualizer layers |

Progression is poetic, meaningful, and **interwoven with theme**.

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `loop_editor_toolset.md` | Enables designers (or advanced players) to define and modify recursive gameplay loops |
| `ritual_feedback_overlay.md` | Visual system to reflect current loop state, depth, or resonance |
| `multi_player_loop_convergence.md` | Handles loop synchronization when multiple players share a recursive structure |
| `loop_decay_and_transformation.md` | Introduces mechanics where loops change or degrade if overused without variation |

---

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> No loop should feel hollow.  
> No action should return unchanged.  
> A loop must **teach**,  
> A loop must **echo**,  
> A loop must become **story**.

In SHAGI, the system breathes through its loops.  
And the player learns to breathe with it.
