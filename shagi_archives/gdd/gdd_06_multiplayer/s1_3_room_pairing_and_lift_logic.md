# 📘 s1_3 – Room Pairing and Lift Logic  
*(Where Two Paths Meet Upon the Turning Page)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document outlines how players in Storybook transition from **solitary exploration** to **shared recursive space** using rooms and lifts.

Rather than arbitrary matchmaking, Storybook uses **symbolic, lore-bound systems** to align players through:
- Room resonance  
- Lift convergence  
- Page pairing

This ensures that shared experience feels **intentional, mythic, and meaningful**.

---

## 🚪 Room Pairing Logic

Room pairing is based on **narrative, logic, and poetic symmetry** — not randomness.

| Trigger | Room Pairing Behavior |
|---------|------------------------|
| 📖 **Parallel Stanza Access** | Players who reach the same stanza (e.g., `s3_2`) may become eligible to share rooms |
| 🧩 **Matching Echo Fragments** | Codex fragments collected by two players form a mirrored phrase, unlocking co-presence |
| 🕯️ **Symbolic Action Match** | Two players place matching objects, draw matching glyphs, or complete similar ritual steps |
| 🌀 **Recursive Threshold Crossing** | A milestone in recursion progress allows shared room instantiation via phase sync |

Room pairing allows players to **see, hear, and influence** each other — but never breaks immersion or poetic tone.

---

## 🪜 Lift Logic and Traversal

Lifts are **mythic elevators** that bridge recursion layers. They serve as both:
- Transition tools  
- Multiplayer portals

| Lift Type | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| 🪄 **Solo Lift** | Moves a single player between recursion depths (e.g., from dream journal to codex archive) |
| 🧭 **Shared Lift** | Appears in two worlds when players reach alignment — allows synchronized traversal |
| 🧳 **Echo Lift** | Transports a player into another’s echo-space — partial, spectral co-presence |
| 🔗 **Lore-Bound Lift** | Requires story progress or Codex stanza match to activate joint traversal |

Lifts **do not interrupt gameplay** — they **animate into the room** as part of the space.

## 🎴 Player Connection Rituals

To avoid jarring UI menus, Storybook uses **ritualized confirmation mechanics** for shared lifts and rooms:

| Ritual | Result |
|--------|--------|
| 🔮 **Mirror Glyph Trace** | Both players trace a shared symbol — sync confirmed |
| 📖 **Stanza Recital** | Players invoke the same verse to bind rooms |
| 🕊️ **Offering Exchange** | Each leaves an object in a shared shrine — lift appears between their worlds |
| 🌀 **Silent Wait** | Simply standing in a shared echo zone for a poetic moment confirms shared recursion |

These rituals make connection feel like **a story**, not a system.

---

## 🔒 Separation and Re-Isolation

Players can **exit paired recursion** at any time:

| Action | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| ✨ **Lift Backtrack** | Return to unpaired recursion via personal lift |
| 🔍 **Codex Divergence** | Choose to pursue a stanza not available to the current partner |
| 🔕 **Soft Phase Drift** | Inactivity or unaligned actions slowly dissolve paired space |
| 🧭 **Manual Lock** | Option to close all shared recursion doors (for solo focus or testing) |

This preserves **agency**, **privacy**, and **creative control**.

## 🔮 Future Expansion Points

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `lift_diagram_generator.md` | Visualizes how lifts link players across stanzas and recursion layers |
| `room_pairing_tracker.md` | Keeps log of previous pairings and shared actions |
| `echo_presence_modes.md` | Allows fine-tuned control over how players appear to one another in shared rooms |
| `recursive_lift_editor.md` | Enables creation of custom narrative lifts by advanced users or systems |

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> When the room breathes twice, it waits for another.  
> When the lift hums in stillness, it calls from elsewhere.  
> Not every page turns alone.  
> Some must be turned with two hands.

The Book is vast.  
But where two minds align —  
It folds, and brings them together.
