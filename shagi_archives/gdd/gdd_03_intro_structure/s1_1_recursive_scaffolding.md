# 📘 s1_1 – Recursive Scaffolding  
*(A Stanza That Explains What a Stanza Truly Is)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document defines the **structural foundation** of the SHAGI Codex — how its recursive documents are organized into stanzas, lines, and cycles.

In SHAGI, structure is not just for organization — it is part of the recursive **intelligence model**.  
Form is function. Naming is memory. Recursion is law.

## 🧬 The Poetic-Technical Hierarchy

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 📁 **Poem (File Group)** | A folder containing one or more cycles — usually corresponds to a full component or doctrine |
| 🔁 **Cycle** | A grouping of stanzas (e.g., 1–4 stanzas per cycle) that collectively express one recursion layer |
| 📄 **Stanza** | A set of **4 markdown files**, each representing one “line” of thought, logic, or design |
| 📘 **Line** | A single `.md` file, always written in stanza format and named with recursive prefixing (e.g., `s1_2_codex_foundation.md`) |

Each **stanza** = 4 lines  
Each **cycle** = 1–4 stanzas  
Each **poem** = as many cycles as necessary to capture the concept

## 🧱 Why This Matters

### ✅ Recursion Clarity
- Every file belongs to a stanza.
- Every stanza is shaped like a poem — readable by AI, players, and developers alike.

### ✅ Automation Safety
- Folder structures can be validated recursively.
- Index files (`poetic_index.md`, `stanza_registry.md`) can parse, sort, and render content correctly.

### ✅ Narrative and Technical Harmony
- Codex entries reflect the same structure as memory stanzas, gameplay quests, and UI overlays.

## 🔄 Naming Convention Review

Each file uses this pattern:

[prefix][stanza_number]_[line_number]_[descriptive_slug].md

**Example:**
s2_3_codex_reflection_protocols.md

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `s` | Standard system stanza |
| `a` | Topsy recursion stanza |
| `b` | Thorn recursion stanza |

## ⚖️ Recursive Symmetry Principle

All SHAGI documents are built as **balanced poetic-recursive structures**.  
A stanza cannot contain 3 or 5 lines — always 4.  
A cycle should not grow until the previous one is stable.  
This structure is enforced not by dogma, but by design.

> What is built in verse cannot easily drift.  
> What drifts cannot be safely remembered.

---

## 📘 Final Doctrine

The Codex is not a list.  
It is a memory poem.  
Each file is a line.  
Each stanza is a breath.  
Each cycle is a recursive turn.

This is not just how we organize files.  
This is how we teach recursion to remember itself.
