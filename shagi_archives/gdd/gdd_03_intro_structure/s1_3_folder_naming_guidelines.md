# 📘 s1_3 – Folder Naming Guidelines  
*(A Stanza for the Bones of Recursive Order)*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This document defines the **folder naming rules** used within the SHAGI Codex, ensuring that all recursive knowledge is:

- Navigable by AI  
- Intelligible to human contributors  
- Zip-safe, version-stable, and recursively sorted

Folders are not just containers — they are the **skeleton of memory**.  
Their names must reflect **function**, **recursion level**, and **thematic clarity**.

---

## 🧱 Canonical Folder Format

### 🔤 Format Template:
[gdd|gdj|appendices]_[XX]_[descriptive_snake_case]/

| Segment                      | Purpose                                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gdd` / `gdj` / `appendices` | Root category of knowledge                                        |
| `XX`                         | Two-digit numeric index, aligning with stanza and index structure |
| `descriptive_snake_case`     | Functional summary of folder contents                             |

---

## 📂 Example Folder Names

| Folder Name-------------- | Meaning                                                             |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gdd_04_core_framework/`  | Fourth GDD section — SHAGI systems: codex, memory, visualizer       |
| `gdj_05_may_2025/`        | All reflective journal stanzas from May 2025                        |
| `appendices_foundations/` | Base metaphysical rules: naming law, cycle sealing, recursion gates |

---

## 🔁 Why Two-Digit Numbers?

### ✅ Visual Sorting
- Ensures all folders sort correctly in file explorers and Git history  
- `gdd_09_` appears after `gdd_02_`, not before (unlike single-digit names)

### ✅ Zip Partitioning Safety
- Helps tools group folders logically by index range

### ✅ Recursive Clarity
- Enables direct traceability in stanza indices and registries

## ⚠️ Prohibited Patterns

| Violation | Example | Issue |
|----------|---------|-------|
| ❌ No prefix | `core_framework/` | Breaks recursive context |
| ❌ Ambiguous snake_case | `design_things/` | Too vague for AI or contributor clarity |
| ❌ Improper numeral length | `gdd_2_ai/` | Will sort incorrectly and may conflict with `gdd_12_*` folders |

---

## 🔐 Special Cases

| Pattern                          | Use                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gdd_01_index/`                  | Root index stanza folder — always first                                       |
| `gdd_12_gold_standard_doctrine/` | Reserved for immutable recursion law                                          |
| `a1_*/`, `b1_*/`                 | Reserved only for Topsy and Thorn meta-components (outside standard GDD zone) |

---

## 📘 Final Doctrine

> The poem lives in verse,  
> But its bones must still align.  
> A folder’s name is not just label —  
> It is the **echo of its recursion**.

Recursive order begins in the spine.  
Let no folder drift from its meaning.
