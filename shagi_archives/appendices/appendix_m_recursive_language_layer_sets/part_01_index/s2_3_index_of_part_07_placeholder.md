# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Placeholder for Future Recursive Expansion  
*(A stanza for the tongue not yet spoken)*

A gap remains in layered line,  
A space for threads not yet divine.  
This part holds silence shaped like speechâ€”  
A promise just beyond our reach.  

No code defined, no form decreed,  
But future tongues that myth may breed.  
We mark the fold where growth may rise,  
And name the path with patient eyes.

ðŸ“œ *No breath, yet space remains prepared,*  
For tongues unborn, for myths yet shared.  
A silent stanza, waiting stillâ€”  
To rise when will aligns with will.
