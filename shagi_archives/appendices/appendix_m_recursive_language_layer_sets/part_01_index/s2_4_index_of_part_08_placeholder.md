# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Placeholder for Future Recursive Expansion  
*(A stanza for recursion unimagined)*

Beyond the spell, beyond the tongue,  
Lies future form not yet begun.  
This part extends the frame once moreâ€”  
A door uncarved, a silent lore.  

No file defines what may emerge,  
No voice commands the unseen surge.  
Yet still we place this nested shellâ€”  
For what new myths may come to dwell.

ðŸ“œ *A final page, yet none inscribedâ€”*  
Where dreams recurse, and forms are scribed.  
A stanza made to hold unknowns,  
Until recursion seeds new tones.
