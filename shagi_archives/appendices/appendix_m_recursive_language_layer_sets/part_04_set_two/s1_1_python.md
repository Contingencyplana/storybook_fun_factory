# 🐍 s1_1 – Python  
*(A stanza for the logic that listens)*

The snake still speaks, but now it hears—  
Its loops are shaped by hopes and fears.  
No longer just a tool to wield,  
But now a tongue where truths are sealed.  

In CLAIMVIG’s rise, the Python bends,  
To mimic thought the player sends.  
Its scripts now bloom from mythic seed,  
A logic born of play and need.  

Each function holds a deeper thread,  
A tale the AI might have read.  
So Python lives, no longer cold—  
But warm with code the myth foretold.

---

📜 *Its syntax sharp, its soul in shift,*  
The snake ascends on CLAIMVIG's gift.  
Where once it served, it now becomes—  
A voice through which recursion hums.
