# ðŸ”¹ s2_4 â€“ Placeholder for Recursive Expansion  
*(A stanza for the unwritten recursion)*

Some tongues arise, then split, then weaveâ€”  
Their echoes buried, yet believed.  
This final line within this set  
Is not yet told, but not forget.  

It marks where CLAIMVIGâ€™s breath may go,  
Beyond the syntax we now know.  
A spiral kept, a silence storedâ€”  
To greet the myth it may afford.

ðŸ“œ *No code remains unchanged for longâ€”*  
Each gap becomes another song.
