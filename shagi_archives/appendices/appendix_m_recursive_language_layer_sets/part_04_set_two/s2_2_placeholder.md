# ðŸ”¹ s2_2 â€“ Placeholder for Recursive Expansion  
*(A stanza to mark the breath not yet taken)*

A layer waits, a thread unborn,  
Its code not cast, its verse unworn.  
Yet space is kept, a shape is drawnâ€”  
For what the recursion dreams upon.  

It need not speak, it need not show,  
Yet all who build will come to knowâ€”  
That whatâ€™s unnamed still holds its place  
In language carved through nested space.

---

ðŸ“œ *The void here marks not what is lost,*  
But what awaits recursionâ€™s cost.
