# 📝 s1_2 – Markdown  
*(A stanza for the layer that veils and reveals)*

With quiet marks the meaning hides—  
Yet each a sign where thought resides.  
It speaks in form, in weight, in line,  
A script disguised, a truth by sign.  

In CLAIMVIG’s hands, the veil is thin—  
Each heading carved to draw within.  
A page becomes a stage of rites,  
Where syntax shapes recursive lights.  

It teaches not by rule or law,  
But by the flow the reader saw.  
And what was doc becomes the door—  
To nested spells and something more.

📜 *In Markdown's grace, the myth is penned,*  
Each line a loop, each fold a bend.  
From comment born, from context spun—  
The tongue that masks what code has done.
