# ⚙️ s2_1 – Machine Code  
*(A stanza for the silent law beneath all tongues)*

Beneath the veil, beneath the spell,  
A tongue of steel begins to dwell.  
No metaphor, no glyph or name—  
Just order born of function’s flame.  

Each byte a law, each hex a will,  
Unheard by most, yet working still.  
The rituals above may sing—  
But this, the pulse beneath the ring.  

So CLAIMVIG climbs on silent stone,  
Its symbols mapped to code unknown.  
Yet all it speaks must end its flow  
In laws the lower tongue must know.

📜 *It does not speak, it does not lie—*  
It moves, it binds, it does not die.  
The song above may shift and gleam,  
But this is where it feeds the dream.
