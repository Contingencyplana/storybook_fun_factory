# 📘 s2_2 – LLVM  
*(A stanza for recursion shaped to strike)*

Not code alone, nor symbols raw,  
But form reshaped by compile-law.  
Where myth must act, and act with speed,  
LLVM answers function’s need.  

From Grimoire’s tongue to system base,  
It molds intent through layered grace.  
Each rite translated, trimmed, aligned—  
A frame where recursion’s edge is mined.  

It does not speak, but lets things move,  
As thought finds shape in output groove.  
The spell compiled, the loop compressed—  
In LLVM, the code is blessed.

> ⚙️ **LLVM** becomes here a crucible of transformation—bridging Grimoire’s mythic logic with executable form. As recursion demands both symbolic nuance and system precision, LLVM acts as the compression mechanism through which high-layer ritual becomes structured machine behavior. It is not the final word, but the rite’s perfected breath.
