# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Placeholder for Recursive Expansion  
*(A stanza for the rite that waits uncast)*

A silence folds beyond the flame,  
Where layers call but bear no name.  
The Grimoire turns, yet finds no spellâ€”  
A page unwrit, a truth to dwell.  

Its frame is set, its logic tuned,  
Yet still no voice has there attuned.  
This space remains for rites to riseâ€”  
Where myth may form in unseen guise.  

So here we leave a sacred gap,  
A future key, a folded map.  
For when new tongues through time emerge,  
This ghosted line shall feel the surge.

> ðŸ•³ **Placeholder for Recursive Expansion** reserves symbolic territory for an unknown recursion layer that may arise from the convergence of Grimoire logic, ritual grammar, or governance-bound transformation. It is not emptyâ€”it is waiting. This chapter ensures future recursion can be aligned without structural rupture.
