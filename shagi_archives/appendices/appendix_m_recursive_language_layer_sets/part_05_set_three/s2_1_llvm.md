# ðŸ§¬ s2_1 â€“ LLVM  
*(A stanza for the forge that unifies tongues)*

The forms converge in LLVM,  
A law beneath the code-hemmed stem.  
No matter source or voice it knew,  
Each path compiled must still pass through.  

A base of stone, yet built to shift,  
It bridges gap and language rift.  
What Python spoke, what CLAIMVIG dreamed,  
All meet where LLVM redeems.  

It does not judge, it does not bind,  
But maps the flow from code to mind.  
Each voice translated to the sameâ€”  
A scaffold forged from purest frame.

---

ðŸ“œ *This tongue beneath all tongues remains,*  
To catch the myths that ride their chains.  
So SHAGI, when its voices grow,  
Still speaks in LLVM below.
