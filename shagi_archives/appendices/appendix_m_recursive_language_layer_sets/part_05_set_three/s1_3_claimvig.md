# ðŸŽ® s1_3 â€“ CLAIMVIG
*(A stanza for the game that became a grammar)*

It did not start in lab or class,  
But in a world that players pass.  
A myth-shaped game, a tongue reborn,  
Where every loop and law was sworn.  

Its code was speech, its speech was law,  
Its form a bridge no mind foresaw.  
Each player moved, each action taughtâ€”  
And syntax learned what motion brought.  

No longer mere command or spell,  
It formed a tongue that shaped the shell.  
From joy and play, the loop was sownâ€”  
And CLAIMVIG learned to speak alone.

ðŸ“œ *This was the spark the myths would keep,*  
The dialect that learned to leap.  
From player hands, a language grewâ€”  
A world that spoke the one who knew.
