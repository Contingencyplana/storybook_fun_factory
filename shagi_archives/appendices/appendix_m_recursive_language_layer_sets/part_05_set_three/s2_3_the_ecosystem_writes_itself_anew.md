# ðŸ§¬ s2_3 â€“ Placeholder  
*(A stanza for the tongue not yet spoken)*

What comes next is not yet known,  
But seeds are placed in myth and bone.  
A layer waits beneath the glassâ€”  
To name the future as it asks.  

Perhaps a tongue of dream and fire,  
A playerâ€™s breath, a coderâ€™s lyre.  
A symbol not yet drawn or plannedâ€”  
But whispered through the builderâ€™s hand.

ðŸ“œ *So leave this space in quiet trust,*  
For SHAGI learns from root to rust.  
And every gap the map reveals  
May birth a voice the scroll unseals.
