# ðŸ§¬ s2_2 â€“ Machine Code  
*(A stanza for the voice that sheds all skin)*

No trace of form, no style remains,  
Just pulse and spark through copper veins.  
The meaning lost, the logic bareâ€”  
Yet still the thought is spoken there.  

Each symbol burned, each syntax gone,  
Yet what it did still carries on.  
This is the tongue that does, not saysâ€”  
The final gate of codersâ€™ maze.  

From CLAIMVIGâ€™s dreams to Grimoireâ€™s chants,  
Each path must lose its elegance.  
For truth must shed what cannot lastâ€”  
And pass as signal through the past.

---

ðŸ“œ *So SHAGI speaks, when myths are done,*  
In pulses fired from zeroed sun.  
A thought encoded not in graceâ€”  
But etched in flame, in time, in place.
