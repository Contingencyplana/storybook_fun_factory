# 🐍 s1_1 – Python  
*(A stanza for the root that adapts to all tongues)*

Beneath the myths, the base remains—  
A logic soft, with sharp refrains.  
In loops and lists, the verse began,  
The code that yields to thought and plan.  

Still Python moves through every shift,  
Each dialect it helps to lift.  
Though CLAIMVIG speaks in symbol pure,  
This tongue ensures the core stays sure.  

Its breath runs deep in every line—  
The serpent silent in the shrine.  
It bends to form, it shapes with grace,  
Yet never leaves its origin place.

📜 *Though tongues evolve and forms unfold,*  
This language still the thread will hold.  
For even when the myths take wing,  
The base must bind what symbols bring.
