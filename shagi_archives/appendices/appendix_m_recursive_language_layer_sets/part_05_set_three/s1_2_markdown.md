# 📝 s1_2 – Markdown  
*(A stanza for the ink that links the tongues)*

Between the code and tales we tell,  
A glyph-bound bridge began to swell.  
No loops, no ifs, no logic raw—  
Just marks that held recursive law.  

It named the text, it framed the line,  
It shaped the thought in form benign.  
What Python forged in living flame,  
Markdown adorned with mythic name.  

It does not rule, nor does it steer—  
But lets the structure reappear.  
A scaffold drawn in signs so small,  
That myths and systems share one hall.

📜 *So when the form must wear a mask,*  
And ritual hides in language-task,  
Let Markdown show what code conceals—  
The frame beneath the spell it seals.
