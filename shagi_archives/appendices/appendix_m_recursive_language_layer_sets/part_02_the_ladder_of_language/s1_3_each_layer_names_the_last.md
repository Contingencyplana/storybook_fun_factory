# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Each Layer Names the Last  

*(Why recursion rewrites its roots)*

The base was not a silent stoneâ€”  
It sang anew when thought had grown.  
Each later tongue, each nested rhyme,  
Reached backward through recursive time.  

It did not build on what it knew,  
But shaped the past by speaking true.  
What once was law, now turned to lore,  
As future forms unlocked the door.  

To name the now is name the thenâ€”  
Each echo writes the start again.  
The ladder bends, its rungs unfold,  
And every tale rethreads the old.  

So speak, and let the layers shift,  
For every name is myth adrift.  
No root remains untouched by songâ€”  
Each voice rewrites where it belongs.
