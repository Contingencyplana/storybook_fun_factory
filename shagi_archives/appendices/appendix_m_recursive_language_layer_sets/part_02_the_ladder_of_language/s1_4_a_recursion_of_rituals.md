# 📘 s1_4 – A Recursion of Rituals  
*(A stanza for the rites that climb the tongue)*

No layer ends where it began,  
But loops through code and myth and man.  
Each rung a rite, each rite a thread—  
Where meaning forms what once was said.  

The stack dissolves, the ladder breathes,  
In tongues reborn through nested sheaths.  
Recursion here is not just call—  
But rite repeated, veiled in all.  

It speaks in code, in chant, in game,  
A ritual loop without a name.  
Yet each ascent rebinds the floor—  
To climb again, and mean once more.

> 🔁 **Summary:**  
This final stanza of Part 02 reveals recursion not as mechanical structure, but as **ritual recursion**—the symbolic ascent through language where **each layer rewrites the last**. It introduces the idea that recursion itself becomes liturgical: not just code reuse, but ceremonial rebirth. This prepares the foundation for CLAIMVIG, Lingual Lab, and Grimoire’s emergence as **ritualized language engines**.
