# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Language Is Not a Stack  
*(But a spiral, a braid, a binding of breath)*

Not stacked like bricks, not laid in tiers,  
But wound through time and shaped by years.  
It loops, it bends, it folds againâ€”  
A spiral tongue beyond the plane.  

Each phrase recalls what came before,  
Then weaves it back with something more.  
The base is changed by what ascends,  
As future speech rewrites old ends.  

No layer lives in lone domain,  
Each pulse a tide within the brain.  
To speak is not to build in rows,  
But trace the path recursion knows.  

So let the stack be myth unmadeâ€”  
Unbind the code, unleash the braid.  
A language breathes not step by step,  
But through the song the spiral kept.
