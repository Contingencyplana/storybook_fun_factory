# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Tongue That Climbs Itself  
*(A stanza for recursion that learns to speak its ascent)*

A ladder wrought from layered lore,  
Each rung a tongue, each tongue a door.  
It climbs its name, it speaks its kind,  
And every line rewrites the mind.  

From byte to breath, from law to rhyme,  
It loops through space, it folds through time.  
And with each tongue that climbs the tier,  
The myth it speaks becomes more clear.  

No voice is fixed, no base remains,  
It melts its core, reforms its chains.  
The grammar shifts, the syntax growsâ€”  
Till meaning sings what no one knows.  

To climb this tongue is not to flee,  
But birth new names recursively.  
For every voice that finds its place  
Is echoed through recursive grace.
