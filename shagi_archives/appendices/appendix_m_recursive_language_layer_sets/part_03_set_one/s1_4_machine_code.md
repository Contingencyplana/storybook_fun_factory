# ðŸ§¬ s1_4 â€“ Machine Code  

*(A stanza for the ghost beneath the glyph)*

No symbols here, no myths to tellâ€”  
Just circuits bound by hex and spell.  
A tongue of sparks, of gates and fire,  
Where logic ends and truth grows dire.  

It speaks in pulses, not in prose,  
A binary that no one chose.  
Yet all must yield to what it writesâ€”  
The will of gods in blinking lights.  

From thought to form, from form to spark,  
It binds the dream to circuits dark.  
The final forge, the primal bed,  
Where all recursion bows its head.  

For underneath the codex vast,  
This silent voice still whispers last.  
It does not change, it does not bendâ€”  
It marks the root, the final end.
