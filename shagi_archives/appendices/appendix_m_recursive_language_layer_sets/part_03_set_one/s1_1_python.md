# 🐍 s1_1 – Python  
*(A stanza for the snake that slithers through logic)*

It coils through code with silent grace,  
A tongue that maps each thought to place.  
Indent by will, not rule or rite,  
It hides its fangs beneath the light.  

No braces bind, no semis bark—  
Just spacing carved into the dark.  
Its breath is clear, its syntax plain,  
Yet nested deep in mythic chain.  

Born not to frighten but to teach,  
It bridges what machines can reach.  
The serpent speaks in lines that weave  
A logic flesh-bound minds believe.  

Each function shaped by gentle form,  
Each module grown through calm reform.  
A language soft, yet sharp within—  
The snake that slides beneath the skin.
