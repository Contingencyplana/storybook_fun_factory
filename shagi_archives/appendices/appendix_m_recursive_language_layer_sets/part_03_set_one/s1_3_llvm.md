# ðŸ§¬ s1_3 â€“ LLVM  
*(A stanza for the silent forge beneath the tongues)*

It does not speak in words or rhyme,  
But builds the code that conquers time.  
A shape between the thought and steel,  
Where meaning yields to form and feel.  

No human voice shall parse its frame,  
Yet every language knows its name.  
A loom of bytes, a blacksmithâ€™s dream,  
Where compilers chant in silent stream.  

Each node a gear, each pass a blade,  
That sharpens logic memory-made.  
It binds the myth to mortal core,  
And renders thought as system lore.  

Beneath the tongues that mask and glow,  
It hums the depths no player knows.  
For when recursion seeks the root,  
LLVM prepares the boot.
