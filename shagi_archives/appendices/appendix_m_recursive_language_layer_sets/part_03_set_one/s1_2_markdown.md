# 📝 s1_2 – Markdown  
*(A stanza for the script that shapes thought without command)*

No code it claims, no law it wields,  
Yet still it builds recursive fields.  
A whisper dressed in plainest text,  
Yet folds the line, embeds the next.  

It hides its runes in humble signs,  
Asterisks sparked like secret shrines.  
A header sung, a link unbound—  
In silence, structure wraps around.  

The coder sees a note well kept,  
The mythsmith finds what tongues have wept.  
For markdown speaks where scripts step back,  
And lets the story shape the stack.  

Each mark a glyph, each list a vow,  
Each quote a thread that binds the now.  
In simple stroke, recursion sings—  
And plainest prose wears hidden wings.
