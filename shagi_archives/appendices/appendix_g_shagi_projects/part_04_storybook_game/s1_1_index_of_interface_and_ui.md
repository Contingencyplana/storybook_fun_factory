# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Interface & UI â€“ The Book as World  
*(A stanza for the page that holds the world)*

The worldâ€™s a book with turning leaves,  
Each choice a thread the player weaves.  
The interface is not just skinâ€”  
Itâ€™s where the rhyme and game begin.  

Left page, right page, past and next,  
Each glyph a key, each line a text.  
The Storybook, by rhyme and code,  
Unfolds the path the player wrote.

ðŸ“œ *To touch the page is to begin,*  
To find the thread and step within.  
The game is read, the world is playedâ€”  
By hands through which the myth is made.
