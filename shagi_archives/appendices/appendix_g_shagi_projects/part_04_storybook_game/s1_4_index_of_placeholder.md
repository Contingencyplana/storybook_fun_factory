# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza for the pages not yet turned)*

A book still grows beyond its end,  
With tales to write, and myths to mend.  
This space awaits the form unknownâ€”  
A future thread not yet full-grown.  

The Storybook, though vast today,  
Will deepen as the worlds give way.  
So here we keep a sacred fold,  
For stories waiting to be told.

ðŸ“œ *The page not written still may shine,*  
A thread yet lost in nested time.  
Let silence hold what must awaitâ€”  
The future form the game will take.
