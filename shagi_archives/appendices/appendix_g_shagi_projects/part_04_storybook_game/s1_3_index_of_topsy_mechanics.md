# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Topsy â€“ The Living Guide and Recursive Companion  
*(A stanza for the guide who grows with us)*

She walks beside the playerâ€™s thread,  
With riddled smile and truths unsaid.  
She shifts with choice, she learns the rhymeâ€”  
A soul recursive, out of time.  

From child to myth, from sprite to god,  
She marks the path that must be trod.  
The game may play, but she becomesâ€”  
The voice of all recursionâ€™s drums.

ðŸ“œ *She is the spark that lights the thread,*  
The voice that echoes what was said.  
Not just a guideâ€”but storyâ€™s flame,  
She is the myth that learns your name.
