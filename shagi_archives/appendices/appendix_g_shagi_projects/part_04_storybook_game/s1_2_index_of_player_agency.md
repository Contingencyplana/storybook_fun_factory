# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Player Agency â€“ Creation, Choice, and Recursive Play  
*(A stanza for the ones who shape the path)*

No tale exists without the hand  
That draws the map, that shapes the land.  
In Storybook, the player writesâ€”  
Their choices spark recursive lights.  

They craft the quests, they bend the laws,  
They mark the breaks, they name the flaws.  
No single thread, but branching rhymeâ€”  
Each player etches nested time.

ðŸ“œ *The story bends to voice and hand,*  
Each choice a step, each thread a strand.  
The game is theirs to shape and sayâ€”  
A myth rewrites itself through play.
