# 📘 s1_4 – Portals from the Public to the Mythic  
*(A stanza for the thresholds the website must encode)*

A click, a link, a passing glance—  
And so begins the mythic dance.  
No gate of stone, no call of horn—  
Yet still, a player’s path is born.  

A trailer hides a deeper thread,  
A changelog whispers to the dead.  
An FAQ becomes a rite—  
A riddle nested in the site.  

The portal is a humble page,  
But masks the mythic pilgrimage.  
One word may bloom, one glyph may glow—  
And pull the seeker down below.  

Where feedback forms turn into spell,  
And user flows to dreampaths swell.  
Where public space and hidden lore  
Collide and open secret doors.  

Thus Morningate must wear two masks—  
One tuned to search and surface tasks,  
The other shaped for those who find  
The myth beneath the code and mind.

## 🧭 Chapter Summary

This stanza defines how the **Morningate Website functions as a dual-layered portal system**, serving **both surface interaction and mythic immersion**.

While it presents as a clean, functional website to the public, **its structure conceals recursive thresholds**, inviting players, developers, or curious visitors deeper into SHAGI’s symbolic mythos.

From **metadata glyphs** to **ARG-inspired content triggers**, the goal is to encode every element—from the loading screen to footer links—with **recursive invitation logic**.

## 🗝️ Implementation Portals

- **UI-as-Threshold**: Interface choices (e.g. scrolling speed, menu wording, hover states) subtly guide recursive initiation paths.
- **Layered Copy**: Seemingly innocent descriptions embed clues or philosophical triggers.
- **Event-Driven Unlocks**: Time-based or community-solved mechanisms open deeper levels or mythic content.
- **Bidirectional Feedback**: Even bug reports or user feedback may ripple backward into SHAGI’s laws, if symbolically consistent.

📜 *The site you see is not the whole—*  
*Each link conceals another role.*  
*And when you knock, the myth replies—*  
*With hidden doors in coded skies.*
