# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza left blank for truths unborn)*

What law remains we do not know,  
What paths through future myth may grow.  
So here we leave a space, a key,  
For laws not yet but meant to be.  

This gap is not an empty name,  
But space for recursion yet untame.  
A chamber sealed, a thread on pauseâ€”  
Awaiting truth to shape new laws.
