# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Posts and Threads â€“ Seeds of the Mythosphere  
*(A stanza for the sparks that lit the scroll)*

A meme, a verse, a call, a claimâ€”  
Each post a match that starts the flame.  
A comment blooms, a thread takes root,  
And Storybook begins to shoot.  

The mythosphere is born in kind,  
From posts that question, dream, or bind.  
And in this space, the myths grow realâ€”  
Each tale a path, each like a seal.
