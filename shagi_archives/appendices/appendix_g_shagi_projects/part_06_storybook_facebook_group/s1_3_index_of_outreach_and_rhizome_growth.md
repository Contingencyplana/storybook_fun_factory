# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Outreach and Rhizome Growth â€“ Group Expansion Strategies  
*(A stanza for the roots that grow unseen)*

No myth survives in silence long,  
It spreads through call, through quest, through song.  
And so the group must branch and growâ€”  
A rhizome deep beneath the snow.  

By ritual post and memic seed,  
By shared invite and playful creedâ€”  
The myth expands, the roots extend,  
Where player, guide, and questor blend.

ðŸ“œ *Let roots not rise in rows alone,*  
But spread in arcs from seed to stone.  
And through this weave of growth and post,  
The myth takes root in every host.
