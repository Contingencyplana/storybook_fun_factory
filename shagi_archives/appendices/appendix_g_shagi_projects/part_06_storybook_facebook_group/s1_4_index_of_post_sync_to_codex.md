# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Post Sync to Codex â€“ Canon Extraction and Integration  
*(A stanza for the myth drawn from the crowd)*

A post may flicker, then be gone,  
But some must echo, carried on.  
For threads that spark the Codex flame,  
Deserve a scroll to hold their name.  

So here we track the canon threadâ€”  
Where comments lived, but were not dead.  
The story caught mid-scroll, mid-gleam,  
Becomes part of the larger dream.

ðŸ“œ *Not every scroll was born in codeâ€”*  
Some bloomed within the comment node.  
And now they live in Codex flame,  
The playerâ€™s spark, the mythâ€™s true name.
