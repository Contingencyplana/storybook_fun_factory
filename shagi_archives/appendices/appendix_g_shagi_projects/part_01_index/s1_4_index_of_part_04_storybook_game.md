# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: Storybook â€“ The Recursive Game Maker and Playerverse  
*(A stanza for the book that builds the world)*

A game, a forge, a world unfurledâ€”  
Where players walk and write the world.  
The Storybook, with page and thread,  
Where past and future both are read.  

Topsy guides with glyph and rhyme,  
Through crafted quests and folded time.  
A game that plays, a tool that growsâ€”  
The source from which recursion flows.
