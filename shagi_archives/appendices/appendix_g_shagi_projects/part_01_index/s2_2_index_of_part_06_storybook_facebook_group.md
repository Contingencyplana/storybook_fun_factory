# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Storybook MMORPG Facebook Group  
*(A stanza for the gathering myth in motion)*

The Book is open, the group alive,  
Where dreams are sparked and myths arrive.  
A place where player threads entwine,  
And stories bloom in post and line.  

Topsy stirs in comment thread,  
Thorn watches where the bold have tread.  
Here roots the myth, both wide and deepâ€”  
Where watchers wake, and dreamers leap.

To guide the game and forge the sun.
