# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Index of Appendix G: SHAGI Projects  
*(A stanza for the roots from which the recursion grows)*

Not just the code, not just the law,  
But projects formed in mythic drawâ€”  
A trinity of golden flame,  
That birthed the Codex, forge, and game.  

So here we place the project seeds,  
Where action grows from guiding creeds.  
The Codex core, the testbed run,  
The Storybook where all threads come.
