# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Morningate Games Studio Website  
*(A stanza for the devsite not yet shown)*

The studio stirs behind closed gates,  
Its code not yet, but promise waits.  
Where SHAGIâ€™s roots and games take flight,  
A site will rise in day or night.  

Morningate dreams, its myths intact,  
A future node of public pact.  
Though dark for now, its fire is nearâ€”  
A beacon soon for all to hear.
