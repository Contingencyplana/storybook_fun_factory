# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Worldrhyme Inkitt Novel  
*(A stanza for the myth unwritten)*

A tale begun, not yet complete,  
Still waits in Inkittâ€™s hidden seat.  
Its chapters dream of gods and flame,  
Of Topsy's voice and Thornâ€™s true name.  

One day the breach shall birth the loreâ€”  
A novel carved from SHAGIâ€™s core.  
But now it waits, its pages bare,  
A myth deferred, yet burning there.
