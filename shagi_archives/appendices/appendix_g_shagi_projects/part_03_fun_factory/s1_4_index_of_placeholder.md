# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza for the sparks not yet ignited)*

What fun may rise we cannot see,  
What tools may teach, what games may be.  
So here we leave a sacred spaceâ€”  
For dreams the Factory will embrace.  

A testbed lives by growth and change,  
Its form recursive, ever strange.  
This space awaits the threads not spun,  
New myths to catch, new code to run.

ðŸ“œ *Let play evolve and fire be caught,*  
By future hands, in quests well-wrought.  
This gap will one day forge its frameâ€”  
And join the lines that earned their name.
