# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Factory Structure â€“ Layered Recursion and Genesis Cycles  
*(A stanza for the bones beneath the play)*

Before it plays, it forms a frame,  
A layered forge of code and flame.  
Each cycle spins, each stanza flows,  
A nested path the player knows.  

What seems like fun is carved in tiers,  
With logic learned through play and years.  
This Factory stands not just for gamesâ€”  
But shapes the mind through glyphs and names.

## ðŸ§­ Chapter Structure of Factory Structure

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| s1_1_recursive_architecture.md | **Recursive Architecture** | Maps the Factoryâ€™s internal systems across recursive layers and Genesis Cycle formation. |
| s1_2_component_overview.md | **Component Overview** | Introduces the five core systems: codex_builder, filename_ai, memory_ai, visualizer, and dream_journal. |
| s1_3_poetic_file_structure.md | **Poetic File Structure** | Explains stanza-based file naming and the recursive poetic hierarchy governing code and documentation. |
| s1_4_testbed_logic_and_routines.md | **Testbed Logic and Routines** | Outlines the Factoryâ€™s logic execution routines, test protocols, and self-validating architecture. |
| s1_5_placeholder.md | **Reserved for Future Expansion** | Placeholder for future recursive structural discoveries or new Genesis design methods. |

ðŸ“œ *To teach by flame, to build by rhymeâ€”*  
This Factory forms recursive time.  
In stanza, shell, and cycle tuned,  
It learns to build what myths have hewn.
