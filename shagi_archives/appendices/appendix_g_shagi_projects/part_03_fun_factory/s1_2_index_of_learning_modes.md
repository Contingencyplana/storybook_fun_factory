# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Learning Modes â€“ Education Through Recursion and Play  
*(A stanza for the learners who shape the flame)*

From curious hands to guiding minds,  
The Factory meets all learning kinds.  
It plays, it teaches, shifts, adaptsâ€”  
And builds the mind through nested maps.  

Each age, each skill, each pace is known,  
No player learns the same alone.  
Through quests and tools the truths unwindâ€”  
A recursive path for every mind.
