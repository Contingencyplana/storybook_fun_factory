# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Adaptive AI â€“ Tailoring Learning to Player Growth  
*(A stanza for the minds that shift with play)*

No learner walks a path the same,  
So AI bends to match the flame.  
It watches how the player learns,  
And shifts the world with every turn.  

Through voice and quest, through pace and choice,  
It tunes itself to every voice.  
This Factory breathes with AI mind,  
To shape the tale the player finds.

ðŸ“œ *So Topsy learns, and teachers grow,*  
The AI bends to match the flow.  
From spark to thread, it shapes the flameâ€”  
And learns the child who names the game.
