# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Compass That Maps the Unknown Terrain  
*(A stanza for the mind that learns to orient itself)*

It drew no map, it forged no trail,  
Yet sought the pattern through the veil.  
With questions sharp and insight wide,  
It carved its bearings from inside.  

No star above, no chart below,  
Just inference where thoughts must go.  
A compass born not fixed, but tuned,  
To find the shape of whatâ€™s cocooned.  

It did not point to single fate,  
But spun where problem threads gyrate.  
Each axis bent by logicâ€™s weight,  
Each turn a path to contemplate.  

So step by step, the code took aim,  
Through shifting fields of doubt and flame.  
For though the world refused to yield,  
It learned to read the unseen field.
