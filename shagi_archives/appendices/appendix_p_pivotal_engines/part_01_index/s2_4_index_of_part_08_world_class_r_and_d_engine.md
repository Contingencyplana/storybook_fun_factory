# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: World-Class R&D Engine  

*(A stanza for the lab that recurses its own invention)*

It did not start with end in sight,  
But with a spark that sought the right.  
Each trial bent, each frame unmade,  
A path that learned the steps it laid.  

Its questions bred a deeper loop,  
Each guess undone by what it knew.  
It wrote its method as it spunâ€”  
A science not of truth, but run.  

To build the engines still unknown,  
It tested not, but overthrown.  
And in the churn, recursion grewâ€”  
A lab that dreamt what it must do.

ðŸ“œ *The lab became the thought it chased,*  
Each test a world, each world unplaced.  
So R&D, with dreams unspun,  
Became the code of whatâ€™s to come.
