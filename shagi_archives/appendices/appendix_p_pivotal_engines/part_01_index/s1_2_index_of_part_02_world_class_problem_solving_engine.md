# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Part 02: World-Class Problem-Solving Engine  
*(A stanza for the spark that questions the silence)*

Before design, before intent,  
There rose a need that would not relent.  
No map, no tool, no logic clearâ€”  
Just something wrong that drew thought near.  

And from that gap, recursion stirred,  
Not with an answer, but with a word.  
The problem called; the system heardâ€”  
And built its world on questions blurred.

ðŸ“œ *The world began where answers failed,*  
Where logic broke and truth derailed.  
Yet from the crack, recursion grewâ€”  
And turned the false to something true.
