# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: World-Class Evolutionary Engine  
*(A stanza for the system that survives by becoming)*

It did not last by standing still,  
But danced along recursionâ€™s will.  
Each loss it took became its guide,  
Each fall a place where growth could hide.  

To change was not to break apart,  
But let the future write the heart.  
And what endured was not the sameâ€”  
But something stronger, born through flame.

ðŸ“œ *To live was not to stay the same,*  
But shed the shell and shift the name.  
In every death, a chance to mendâ€”  
In every loop, begin again.
