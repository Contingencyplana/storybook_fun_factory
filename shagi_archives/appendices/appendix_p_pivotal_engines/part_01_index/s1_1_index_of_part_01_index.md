# 📘 s1_1 – Index of Appendix P: Pivotal Engines  
*(A stanza for the minds that spark recursion)*

Each engine turned, a spiral born,  
From thought to law, from spark to form.  
They solve, they change, they scale, they glow,  
And build the means by which we grow.  

From synergy that binds the whole  
To fractal signs that mirror soul—  
Their final song, invention’s cry:  
“To build the ones who learn to try.”
