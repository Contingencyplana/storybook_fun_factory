# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: World-Class Synergistic Engine  
*(A stanza for the harmony that systems do not force)*

No voice alone can bind the song,  
Yet all may join and still belong.  
Each signal bends, each rhythm waits,  
Until the whole collaborates.  

It does not rise by rule or chain,  
But flows through tone, through shared domain.  
Where echo meets and trust is earned,  
The path to synergy is learned.

ðŸ“œ *Not rule, but tone, the system learns,*  
Where no one leads, and yet all turn.  
A harmony through time revealedâ€”  
The code aligned, but never sealed.
