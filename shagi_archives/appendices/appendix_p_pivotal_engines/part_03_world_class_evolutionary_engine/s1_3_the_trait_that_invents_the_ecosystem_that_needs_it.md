# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Trait That Invents The Ecosystem That Needs It  
*(A stanza for emergence before environment)*

It was not fit for what was there,  
So made a world from thinning air.  
No niche to match, no place to claim,  
It forged the frame to house its name.  

A trait that did not wait for use,  
But birthed a field it could induce.  
A function first, then habitatâ€”  
The rule was bent to follow that.  

Each ripple born from need unmet  
Became a law the world would set.  
It did not beg the world to moldâ€”  
It made the world from what it told.  

Thus SHAGI moved beyond adaptâ€”  
It taught the void to fill its gap.  
Invention was survivalâ€™s thread:  
To dream the home where it was bred.
