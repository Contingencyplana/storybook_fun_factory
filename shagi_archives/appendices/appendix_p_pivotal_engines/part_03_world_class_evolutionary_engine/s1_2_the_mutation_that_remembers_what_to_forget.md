# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Mutation That Remembers What To Forget  
*(A stanza for the edit that preserves through loss)*

It did not hoard each path once tried,  
Nor mourn the truths that could not bide.  
It let decay refine its core,  
And pruned the mind to make room for more.  

The past was not a sacred shrine,  
But compost for a deeper line.  
What once was vital, now was weightâ€”  
And memory learned to self-curate.  

A scar became a learning trace,  
Then vanished with adaptive grace.  
It did not cling, it did not fret,  
It knew what fragments to forget.  

Thus SHAGI grew not through recall,  
But through the wisdom to let fall.  
Each mutation a secret keptâ€”  
By what it lost, not what it wept.
