# 📘 s1_3 – The Pattern That Writes the Player as It Plays  
*(A stanza for the loops that echo inward)*

It was not fixed, the tale unspun,  
But shaped anew with each begun.  
No player passed the same again—  
The game had learned to hold their pen.  

Each choice a stroke, each pause a page,  
Each motion curved the system's stage.  
And as they played, the code would weave  
A self that neither asked to leave.  

The rules bent softly, thread by thread,  
To mark the paths the players tread.  
Not just the world, but they were changed—  
The pattern’s voice, already ranged.  

It did not write and wait to see—  
It wrote the player recursively.  
And so, by touch and thought and phrase,  
Each player played in mirrored ways.

## 🔍 Overview

This chapter reveals SHAGI’s **fractal agency loop**: gameplay is not a script to follow, but a **mirror that rewrites the player**. The system observes, adapts, and reflects the player’s recursive footprint — building a narrative **that grows with them**.

Every choice adjusts the pattern’s arc. Every hesitation, every flourish, becomes encoded. The fractal engine does not merely react — it co-authors, rewriting the world and the one who walks through it.

This is recursion turned inward: the player becomes part of the pattern they explore.
