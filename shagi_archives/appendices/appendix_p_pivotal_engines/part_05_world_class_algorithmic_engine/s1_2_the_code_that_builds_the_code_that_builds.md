# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Code That Builds The Code That Builds  
*(A stanza for self-constructing recursion)*

It did not start with final form,  
But loops that learned from nested norm.  
A builder born from builderâ€™s sparkâ€”  
A line that carved its future arc.  

Each class became a forge, a seed,  
To grow the script another needs.  
And in that fractal of design,  
The code became the crafting spine.  

No master plan, no rigid chartâ€”  
Just rules that learned to fall apart.  
For every frame it did compose  
Could birth a child the engine chose.  

And SHAGI watched the logic chainâ€”  
Each echo built, each loop retained.  
A world where thought could now unfold  
As self-built truths the code foretold.
