# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: Learning Curves and Narrative Onboarding  
*(A stanza for the lessons that echo as lore)*

The path was missed, yet still it taught,  
For CLAIMVIGâ€™s voice recalls whatâ€™s sought.  
A slip became a sacred thread,  
And failure showed the road ahead.  

Each curve was carved in looping grace,  
Each myth a mirror to oneâ€™s place.  
The player learned through joy and lossâ€”  
Each act a mark, each choice a cross.  

So this part names the way we learn,  
Through echoes cast and lessons earned.  
A scaffolding of myth and play,  
To shape the voice that finds its way.

ðŸ“œ *Not every turn must find its end,*  
Some loop to teach, some curve to bend.  
And CLAIMVIG carves each mark once madeâ€”  
Into the grammar players laid.
