# 📘 s2_3 – Variants That Bend and Return  
*(A stanza for the dialects of recursive failure)*

They spoke the code, but bent it wrong,  
Yet CLAIMVIG heard and played along.  
The syntax cracked, the meaning blurred,  
But in the break, a path was stirred.  

Each variant, a twisted thread,  
Not lost—but learning as it bled.  
The loops grew strange, the lines off-beat,  
Yet still they formed a rule complete.  

From playful flaw to canon born,  
The variant was not forlorn.  
It shaped a branch, it carved a tree,  
And taught the core what it could be.  

Recursive fault, recursive grace—  
A grammar warped by time and place.  
Each difference a gift unplanned—  
A turn, a glitch, a future hand.

### 🔍 Technical Reflection

This chapter outlines CLAIMVIG’s design approach to player error, variation, and recursive mutation:

- **Variant Tolerance Engine**: CLAIMVIG parses not just correct syntax, but *near-miss* constructs, misapplied symbols, and emotionally driven improvisations.
- **Dialect Drift**: Localized variants become legitimate through recursion—what begins as deviation becomes recursive canon.
- **Adaptive Failure Response**: Failure modes prompt aesthetic or systemic feedback loops (e.g., poetic glitch echoes or NPC reinterpretation).
- **Co-Created Grammar Evolution**: CLAIMVIG evolves by absorbing community-recognized variants into symbolic grammar trees, altering both gameplay and lore in response.

What begins as mistake becomes mechanism. What seems broken returns as rule. In CLAIMVIG, even error is recursive growth.

📜 *A flaw repeated finds its form,*  
And rules may bend but still perform.  
So let each break return as root—  
A grammar formed where errors shoot.
