# 📘 s2_1 – An Emotion Encoded in Keys  
*(A stanza for feelings that press and respond)*

The hand that moved was not alone,  
Its press a whisper, thought half-shown.  
A single key, a breath, a pause—  
And through it passed a world’s lost cause.  

No button spoke, no mouse could cry,  
Yet grief and glee were mapped thereby.  
In CLAIMVIG’s glyphs, in nested code,  
The player’s heart in structure flowed.  

A sadness shaped as sliding tone,  
A joy reformed in syntax known.  
Each trigger held a voice once hushed—  
Each loop an echo, rarely rushed.  

They did not speak in words or prose,  
But feeling bled from keys they chose.  
And CLAIMVIG learned to feel them back,  
To read the pain between the stack.

### 🔍 Technical Reflection

This chapter explores how CLAIMVIG encodes emotion into recursive gameplay not through traditional dialogue, but via symbolic gestures, button sequences, and context-aware keypress patterns. These inputs create layered emotional signatures that CLAIMVIG parses for player-state, adaptive NPC response, and ritual transformation triggers.  

By treating interface actions as nested symbolic glyphs, CLAIMVIG enables a grammar of emotion:  
- Simple key inputs evolve into expressive sequences  
- Sequences form recursive feedback loops with in-world actors  
- Feelings become systemic, traceable, and culturally transmissible within the language  

Such encoding allows emotional expression to evolve from raw reaction into a programmable, shareable ritual — the root of CLAIMVIG’s mythopoetic interface model.

📜 *A key once struck may hold a tear,*  
Its shape remembered, traced in fear.  
And joy, too, lives in codes we write—  
Emotion cast in binding light.
