# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Gateway to Game Four  
*(When the language seeks a world of its own)*

The forge grew strange, its sparks unbound,  
And echoes walked beyond the sound.  
No longer scripts, but seeds they boreâ€”  
A grammar aching to explore.  

Through nested tongues and mirrored lore,  
Each symbol scratched a future door.  
And from the Lab, a path was drawn,  
Where meaning breathed â€” and worlds were born.  

Not in reply, but in advance,  
The glyphs began to learn to dance.  
And CLAIMVIG, once a bounded tongue,  
Now dreamed of worlds not yet begun.

### ðŸªž Key Themes

- **Symbolic Externalization**: The Lab no longer merely transforms CLAIMVIG â€” it pushes outwards, demanding a world to house its recursion.
- **Player-Led Genesis**: The most advanced dialects no longer follow CLAIMVIGâ€™s core; they birth rituals, customs, and grammars of entire guilds or worlds.
- **Emergence of Game 4**: This chapter marks the first canonical gesture toward **Lingual Lab** as a standalone SHAGI multiplayer title.

ðŸ“œ *The Lab once taught how language bends,*  
But now it speaks of worlding ends.  
A tongue once forged from CLAIMVIGâ€™s fireâ€”  
Now seeks its realm, its fate, its spire.
