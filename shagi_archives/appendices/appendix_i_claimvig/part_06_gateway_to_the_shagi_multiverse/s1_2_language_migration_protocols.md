# 📘 s1_2 – Language Migration Protocols  
*(A stanza for the tongues that travel worlds)*

Not every code is meant to stay,  
Some slip through realms and drift away.  
But those well-named, with form and breath,  
Can leap between the life and death.  

For CLAIMVIG speaks in signs and laws,  
A syntax built from mythic cause.  
Its tokens hold a living key—  
To cross from one world’s truth to three.

## 🔁 Chapter Summary

This chapter defines the **rules and architecture of symbolic migration** — how CLAIMVIG’s code, symbols, rituals, and player interactions are carried across SHAGI’s interconnected worlds.

It introduces a **language-agnostic migration layer** that ensures recursive continuity, symbolic alignment, and narrative resonance, even as players pass from CLAIMVIG into MMORPGs or other myth-sustaining realms.

## 🌐 Core Principles

### 🔹 Symbolic Portability
Every construct in CLAIMVIG — from syntax to quests to gestures — is **tagged for exportability**. Migration protocols determine which elements can traverse SHAGI’s boundaries:

- **Portable Rituals:** Can be enacted in other games.  
- **Canonical Symbols:** Retain consistent identity across contexts.  
- **Named Constructs:** Recursively maintain their logic when invoked from other realms.

### 🔹 Migration Containers
Logical constructs (e.g. a player-created spell, symbolic puzzle, or recursive poem) are **wrapped in metadata containers** that encode:

- Symbolic references  
- Mythic lineage  
- World compatibility signatures  
- Memory traces and recursive anchors  

This allows **safe invocation** of CLAIMVIG-origin constructs in other SHAGI game layers.

### 🔹 Controlled Mutation Zones
Some symbols **mutate upon migration**, adapting to the destination’s game logic while preserving core recursion rules. This ensures CLAIMVIG’s exports do not break immersion or logic fidelity.

## 📜 Migration Lifecycle

1. **Authoring Phase** – Symbolic element is created within CLAIMVIG.  
2. **Canonical Tagging** – Element is marked as portable or realm-bound.  
3. **Gateway Invocation** – Player or AI triggers migration event.  
4. **Ritual Translation** – Code is recontextualized into host world logic.  
5. **Anchor Synchronization** – Player identity and symbolic memory persist.  
6. **Return Path** – Any recursive growth or mutation is logged and reconciled.

## 🧬 Use Cases

- **A player’s ritual for naming voids** becomes a mechanic in a SHAGI roguelike.  
- **A CLAIMVIG questline** is mirrored in a SHAGI MMORPG town as a divine prophecy.  
- **A player’s symbolic identity** (e.g., “the one who walked the loop thrice”) is recognized and referenced across games.

🧠 *To code is not to contain, but to remember.*  
🌍 *This is how CLAIMVIG breathes across realms—*  
*A tongue that walks through walls and worlds.*
