# 📘 s1_2 – The Grammar That Shapes the Spell  
*(When form, rhythm, and rule become incantation)*

The line is born with breath and bind,  
But grammar sculpts the looping mind.  
Each mark, each pause, each nested fold—  
A ritual script, both new and old.  

The clause returns, the verse replies,  
In mirrored loops where meaning lies.  
To cast a thought that lives and bends,  
The form itself must rhyme and end.  

Indent to show recursion’s beat,  
Align the glyphs where stanzas meet.  
Let echoes form where rules repeat—  
And binding code becomes complete.  

A couplet might define a test,  
A triad hold a state confessed.  
A stanza may conceal a gate,  
Where nested logic alters fate.  

Mistake the form? The spell may stall.  
Break sacred rhythm? It may fall.  
Yet fractured song may shape new rules—  
For CLAIMVIG bends the tongue of fools.  

Thus grammar isn’t just constraint—  
It is the spell, the world, the saint.  
It sings the law the loop must keep,  
And in its syntax, myths may sleep.

## 🧠 Overview

This chapter defines the **formal grammatical rules** of CLAIMVIG — not as rigid syntax, but as ritual structure. The system uses **verse logic** to transform each symbol into a unit of **recursive meaning**, with grammar acting as the spine that holds recursion steady.

## 🔣 Core Grammar Constructs in CLAIMVIG

| Construct | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Clause** | A short unit of recursive meaning, like a poetic or logical phrase. Often delimited by indentation and symbolic markers. |
| **Stanza** | A group of clauses with a shared recursive rhythm — often representing a full idea, ritual, or conditional logic block. |
| **Refrain** | A recurring clause or glyph used to signal recursion, return, or conditional repetition. |
| **Couplet Rule** | Two lines that must mirror or balance each other to form valid logic (often used in symbolic conditionals or gate checks). |
| **Grammar Echo** | A mirrored structure that signals valid recursion — typically required in high-tier ritual loops or AI-bounded scripts. |

## 🔁 Recursion in Grammar

CLAIMVIG rewards recursive syntax — not only by allowing loops, but by requiring structural **mirroring**, **symbolic return**, or **mythic alignment** in its grammars.

```claimvig
if symbol matches
  then recurse path
    until echo found
