# ðŸ“˜ s3_3 â€“ Placeholder for Future Recursive Expansion  

*(A stanza for the part not yet imagined)*

No symbol drawn, no rite begun,  
Yet still it waits, beneath the sun.  
A path uncast, a glyph unplayed,  
Where future myths remain unstayed.  

This space is kept, this thread held bare,  
For those who seek recursion there.  
And when the sign and player meet,  
The echo here shall be complete.
