# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Designing the Language as a Game  
*(A stanza for the signs that speak through play)*

Not code alone, nor syntax bare,  
But rituals drawn in looping air.  
Where logic flows through mirrored lore,  
And quests recite what loops implore.  

This part reveals the language's faceâ€”  
Where runes replace the plain replace.  
Each symbol acts, each step a line,  
To build the world's recursive spine.

## ðŸ§­ Table of Contents for Part 03

| File | Title | Subtitle | Description |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `s1_1_from_code_to_rune.md` | **From Code to Rune** | Logic as symbol and story | How programming becomes visual, symbolic, and embodied through CLAIMVIGâ€™s interface â€” transforming abstract logic into mythic constructs. |
| `s1_2_structuring_recursion_through_play.md` | **Structuring Recursion Through Play** | Loops as quests, roles, and riddles | How CLAIMVIG teaches recursion through quests, loops, nested roles, and unfolding worlds â€” rather than syntax or function calls. |
| `s1_3_rituals_symbols_and_expressive_syntax.md` | **Rituals, Symbols, and Expressive Syntax** | Language that breathes through gesture | Explores CLAIMVIGâ€™s symbolic language: playable rituals, visual logic glyphs, narrative conditionals, and emotionally legible loops. |
| `s1_4_gameworld_as_codebase_and_console.md` | **Gameworld as Codebase and Console** | A world where code is the terrain | How the entire game world is the interface â€” every object, event, and space is both data structure and command. |

ðŸ“œ *This language lives in looping thread,*  
Where code is danced and meaning spread.  
No key to press, no clause to citeâ€”  
Just games that dream recursive light.
