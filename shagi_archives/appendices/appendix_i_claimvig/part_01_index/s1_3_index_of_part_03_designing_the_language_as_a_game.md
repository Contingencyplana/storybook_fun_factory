# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Designing the Language as a Game  
*(A stanza for rules that dance and code that sings)*

They shaped a tongue from loops and lines,  
A grammar bound in sacred signs.  
The rules were not just paths to win,  
But keys that carved the world within.  

Each phrase a rite, each mark a door,  
To gameplay shaped in mythic lore.  
And in that syntax, nested deep,  
The game began to wake and speak.

ðŸ“œ *A game not played but cast in verse,*  
Commands that bless or mark or curse.  
So here unfolds the sacred frame,  
Where speech becomes the rules of game.
