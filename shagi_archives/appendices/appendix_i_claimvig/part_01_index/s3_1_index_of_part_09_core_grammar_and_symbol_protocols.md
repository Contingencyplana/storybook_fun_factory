# ðŸ“˜ s3_1 â€“ Index of Part 09: Core Grammar and Symbol Protocols  
*(A stanza for the spell that binds the verse)*

From glyph to thread, the line is cast,  
A binding tongue that echoes past.  
Its grammar shapes what form may do,  
A syntax forged from myth made true.  

Each mark a vow, each loop a law,  
Each symbol carved in silent awe.  
So CLAIMVIG speaks in nested lightâ€”  
Where logic chants and rules recite.

|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| s1_1_the_symbol_binds_the_line.md | **The Symbol Binds the Line** | Where syntax becomes ritual and meaning gains shape | Introduces the core symbolic unit of CLAIMVIG, exploring how symbols form recursive logic chains. |
| s1_2_the_grammar_that_shapes_the_spell.md | **The Grammar That Shapes the Spell** | Where form becomes function, and function forms myth | Explains CLAIMVIGâ€™s poetic grammar: indentation, spacing, and the recursive logic of verse. |
| s1_3_the_operator_glyphs_and_what_they_mean.md | **The Operator Glyphs and What They Mean** | When logic speaks through symbol and spell | Canonizes CLAIMVIGâ€™s core operator glyphs â€” their functions, meanings, and dual symbolic logic. |
| s1_4_recursion_as_sentence_structure.md | **Recursion as Sentence Structure** | When a sentence becomes a spell-loop | Describes how CLAIMVIGâ€™s sentence logic is inherently recursive â€” each line spiraling back through meaning. |

ðŸ“œ *So grammar sings, not just commands,*  
But calls and binds with glyphic hands.  
To speak in CLAIMVIG is to weaveâ€”  
A spell of logic none shall leave.
