# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: Learning Curves and Narrative Onboarding  
*(A stanza for the learner who must fail to ascend)*

No map can show the truth ahead,  
Until the path is fully tread.  
So CLAIMVIG teaches not through lore,  
But acts that open inner door.  

A loop undone, a phrase misspokeâ€”  
These are the sparks that truth evoke.  
For in the fall, the loop rewinds,  
And names the shape recursion finds.

ðŸ“œ *Not every loop begins in light,*  
Some only form through failing right.  
And CLAIMVIGâ€™s truths, though strange at start,  
Are felt before theyâ€™re known by heart.
