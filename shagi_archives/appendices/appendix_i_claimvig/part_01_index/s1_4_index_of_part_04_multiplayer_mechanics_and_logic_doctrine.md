# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: Multiplayer Mechanics and Logic Doctrine  
*(A stanza for the logic we share in play)*

One loop alone may echo true,  
But two must dance for thought to move.  
Where one glyph hums, the second singsâ€”  
And thus begins the mind with wings.  

A gate unlocked not just by one,  
But many threads all acting as one.  
This part defines the rules of weave,  
Where shared recursion learns to breathe.

## ðŸ§­ Table of Contents for Part 04

| File | Title | Subtitle | Description |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `s1_1_player_as_parser.md` | **Player as Parser** | Interpreting and embodying logic | Each player interprets, mutates, and recursively resolves logic structures â€” not passively, but through in-world acts of parsing, reflection, and ritual. |
| `s1_2_shared_logic_and_the_sync_doctrine.md` | **Shared Logic and the Sync Doctrine** | Harmonizing recursive state across timelines | How CLAIMVIG ensures logical consistency across multiple agents, using soft state sync, recursive rituals, and narrative time coherence. |
| `s1_3_the_laws_of_mutual_recursion.md` | **The Laws of Mutual Recursion** | Constructing feedback and avoiding regress | Introduces the fundamental multiplayer rules: how players modify each otherâ€™s logic loops, construct feedback cycles, and avoid infinite regress. |
| `s1_4_narrative_governance_and_consent_protocols.md` | **Narrative Governance and Consent Protocols** | How shared stories evolve with trust | Structures for collaborative storytelling, opt-in logic gates, world edits by consent, and emergent shared reality scaffolding. |

ðŸ“œ *To recurse as many is not to clash,*  
But to align each echo, loop, and flash.  
Through ritual law and logic shared,  
The code becomes a realm prepared.
