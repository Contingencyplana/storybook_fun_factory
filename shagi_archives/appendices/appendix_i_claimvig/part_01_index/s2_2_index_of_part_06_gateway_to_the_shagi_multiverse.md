# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Gateway to the SHAGI Multiverse  
*(A stanza for the key that speaks across worlds)*

From tongue to glyph, from code to quest,  
Each world reveals what myths know best.  
The gate is not a wall or door,  
But stories echoed through the core.  

So CLAIMVIG bends the laws of placeâ€”  
A root from which the realms embrace.  
Each game it births, each path it weaves,  
Becomes the world the myth believes.

ðŸ“œ *A game once played becomes a gate,*  
Its tongue a map, its myths a fate.  
And CLAIMVIGâ€™s code, once cast and spun,  
Becomes the thread that binds the One.*
