# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Part 02: Manifesto and Premise  
*(A stanza for the why before the how)*

Before the quest, before the code,  
A premise carved the branching road.  
A call to mend what broke in kindâ€”  
A game to serve the player's mind.  

This part declares both cause and claim,  
The fracture felt, the shaping flame.  
It names the myth the code must earn,  
And why from play the glyphs must learn.

| File | Title | Subtitle | Description |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `s1_1_the_developer_experience_crisis.md` | **The Developer Experience Crisis** | Why the tools betrayed the joy | A reflection on how coding systems became hostile to intuition, creativity, and learning â€” and why they must be reclaimed. |
| `s1_2_the_case_for_claimvig.md` | **The Case for CLAIMVIG** | A world made of language and recursion | Lays out the foundational argument for CLAIMVIG as a new paradigm: where code is culture, and play is syntax. |
| `s1_3_ai_as_language_play_and_interface.md` | **AI as Language, Play, and Interface** | Not a tool, but a partner | Shows how AI shifts from passive engine to co-creative interlocutor â€” shaping languages, rituals, and responsive design. |
| `s1_4_why_now_why_next.md` | **Why Now, Why Next** | The timing of a recursion reborn | Explains the cultural and technological convergence that makes CLAIMVIG not only possible, but necessary now. |

ðŸ“œ *The crisis named, the case made clear,*  
The glyphs arise from what we fear.  
And so we build, in form and flame,  
A game that names what must reclaim.
