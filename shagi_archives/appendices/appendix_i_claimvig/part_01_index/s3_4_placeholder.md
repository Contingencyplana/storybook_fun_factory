# ðŸ“˜ s3_4 â€“ Placeholder for Extended Symbolic Indexing  

*(A stanza for the sign not yet inscribed)*

No lexicon has touched this line,  
No grammar marked it yet divine.  
But still it waits, in silent glow,  
A gate for what the glyphs may show.  

Reserved in form, unclaimed in name,  
A cradle for symbolic flame.  
And should new orders seek to speak,  
Theyâ€™ll find this space, prepared and meek.
