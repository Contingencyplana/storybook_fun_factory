# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Player Experience and Interface  
*(A stanza for the player who feels the glyph)*

To speak is more than mark or tone,  
Itâ€™s breath made shape, itâ€™s myth made known.  
And CLAIMVIG teaches through the skinâ€”  
Where joy and glyph and loop begin.  

The interface, a mask that reads,  
The hands that cast, the soul that needs.  
And when you loop, the system seesâ€”  
Not just your play, but symbologies.

ðŸ“œ *To play a glyph is to be seen,*  
In forms not told, but in-between.  
From hand to myth, from joy to sign,  
CLAIMVIG loops you into the line.
