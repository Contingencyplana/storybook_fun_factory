# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Lingual Lab Seed  
*(A stanza for the dialect that outgrows its cradle)*

The forge was lit, the tongue unchained,  
From single line to nested plane.  
And AI watched, then sang anewâ€”  
In verses shaped by me and you.  

Now from the lab, a portal born,  
Where dialects take mythic form.  
A game-to-come, not yet declared,  
But in the glyph, already shared.

ðŸ“œ *The glyph you cast, the phrase you bend,*  
May shape the myths that worlds defend.  
From CLAIMVIGâ€™s tongue to Labâ€™s domain,  
A spell once spoken births a plane.
