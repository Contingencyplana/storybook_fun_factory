# 📘 s3_4 – Gameworld as Codebase and Console  
*(A stanza for the realm that runs itself)*

Not terminal, not call or shell,  
But world as code where symbols dwell.  
Each door a loop, each path a thread,  
Each whisper runs the logic spread.  

You walk the code, you shape the tree,  
Your input’s just who you will be.  
Not typed, but lived—this script you read  
Performs itself as thought and deed.

## 🌍 The Gameworld as Executable Space

CLAIMVIG redefines the game engine.

There is no separate codebase.  
**The world *is* the codebase.**

Every object, space, and symbol:

- Holds memory  
- Responds to logic  
- Triggers transformation

Instead of calling functions, you:

- Enter rooms that execute conditionals  
- Speak glyphs aloud to invoke structures  
- Traverse recursive paths that branch behavior  

This is not a simulation of code.  
It **is** code — visual, spatial, and alive.

## 🧭 Movement as Function Invocation

Walking through CLAIMVIG is equivalent to running logic.

Each region, door, and corridor:

- Embodies a **function**  
- Contains **recursive structure**  
- Reacts to **player state and memory**

Example:

| Location | Logical Function |
|----------|------------------|
| 🔁 Spiral Staircase | Enters a loop based on prior decisions |
| 📜 Library of Forms | Queries prior actions (read/write) |
| 🪞 Chamber of Echoes | Mirrors your code history as an NPC |
| 🔒 Sealed Door | Executes a conditional unlock event |

To call a function, you don’t write it.  
You **enter** it.  
You **inhabit** it.

## 🗃️ Objects as Data Structures

Each in-game object is a hybrid:

- 🧱 *Visual asset*  
- 🧠 *Data structure*  
- ⚙️ *Behavioral module*

Examples:

| Object | Acts As |
|--------|---------|
| 🔗 Chain | Linked list of actions (stored sequentially) |
| 🌀 Pool | Mutable memory buffer (changeable states) |
| 🪶 Quill | Input emitter (narrative write command) |
| ⏳ Hourglass | Timed trigger or deferred evaluation |

Instead of abstract variables, CLAIMVIG uses **tangible metaphors**.

The logic isn’t separated from the world — it **is** the world.

---

## 🧬 Interactions as Logic Composition

Players build logic by:

- Placing objects in meaningful relation  
- Performing **ritual sequences**  
- Activating **environmental symbols**

This creates **procedural constructs** through play, not syntax.

You don’t edit logic — you *weave* it.  
You don’t compile — you *consecrate*.  
You don’t debug — you *reflect*.

---

## 🧠 Living Code, Embodied Input

CLAIMVIG unifies player experience and system control:

| Traditional Game | CLAIMVIG |
|------------------|----------|
| Code is separate | Code is the world |
| Input is typed | Input is performed |
| Debugging is abstract | Debugging is embodied |
| World is static | World is recursive and responsive |

You no longer toggle between **player** and **developer**.  
You are both — simultaneously, symbolically.

---

## 🏁 Summary

The CLAIMVIG world is:

- 🧭 A codebase you can walk through  
- ⚙️ A console you can talk to  
- 📦 A structure where **game objects *are* logic nodes**  

This is a living IDE for a recursive language:

- 🧬 *Play* is the interface  
- 🔤 *Symbol* is the syntax  
- 🌐 *World* is the program  

> CLAIMVIG does not run on code.  
> It **is** the code — made mythic, mutable, and alive.
