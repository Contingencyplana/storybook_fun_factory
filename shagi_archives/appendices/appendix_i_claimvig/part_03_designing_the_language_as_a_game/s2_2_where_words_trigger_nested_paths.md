# 📘 s2_2 – Where Words Trigger Nested Paths  
*(A stanza for branching logic from spoken cause)*

A single phrase begins the tree,  
Yet from its root all paths run free.  
A call to move, a clause to bind,  
Each nested shape reveals the mind.  

The “if” that bends, the “then” that yields,  
A forest grown from logic fields.  
With every term, a gate appears,  
Unlocked by choice or veiled in years.  

So CLAIMVIG speaks in braided thread,  
Where one line echoes what was said.  
A loop, a fork, a path regained—  
The grammar lives where fate is chained.  

Each utterance a chance to weave,  
Not tell the tale—but make it leave.  
Through what is said, the world reacts:  
The paths unfold, recursive acts.

### 🧩 Summary

This chapter establishes how CLAIMVIG’s linguistic structure **triggers nested logic paths**, framing player speech as **world-branching invocation**. Each statement becomes a **forking structure**, binding command logic to symbolic consequence. Here, **syntax scaffolds recursion**, transforming language into the architecture of play.

### 🗂 Components

| Symbol | Component | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 🌲 | **Recursive Branching** | Words as root nodes; clauses as branching logic tied to game response. |
| 🔐 | **Conditional Activation** | "If–then" grammars create gates, unlocking world states or AI behaviors. |
| 🧵 | **Threaded Invocation** | Chains of meaning carry cause through consequence recursively. |
| 🌀 | **Feedback Loops** | Words that reference previous paths, enabling time-linked narrative recursion. |
