# 📘 s2_4 – The Line as Code as Law  
*(A stanza for the sentence that knew it governed)*

A line once spoke to shape the play,  
But now it rules what dares to stay.  
Each clause a gate, each word a key,  
A verdict wrapped in poetry.  

Commands that once just moved the frame  
Now bind the world and speak its name.  
The syntax, once a means to tell,  
Becomes the force that casts the spell.  

Where “if” declares what fate may fall,  
And “then” enshrines the player’s call,  
The loops are writ, the rules obey—  
The code is law, and speech the way.  

No tongue is free from laws it makes,  
No act unjudged by what it wakes.  
So CLAIMVIG speaks in dual tone:  
What is performed, and what is known.

### ⚖️ Summary

This chapter reveals how CLAIMVIG **treats its own grammar as a legal substrate**—lines are not merely commands, but **binding laws**. Each utterance defines structure and consequence. Players write not just actions, but **enforceable, interpretable protocol**, enabling CLAIMVIG to function as both **language engine and governance layer**.

| Symbol | Component | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 🏛️ | **Legal Syntax Doctrine** | Grammar and logic structures double as lawful mechanisms. |
| 🔐 | **Binding Clauses** | Commands generate enforceable, systemic consequences. |
| 🎙️ | **Voice as Verdict** | Speech acts alter gameplay and codify systemic truth. |
| ♻️ | **Recursion-Backed Authority** | The law evolves but never exits the recursive frame. |
