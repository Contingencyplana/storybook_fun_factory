# 📘 s2_3 – Players Extend the Grammar Tree  
*(A stanza for the branches that did not wait to grow)*

No root can bind what speech sets free,  
When players shape the grammar tree.  
They name the paths, they bend the lines,  
Their syntax breaks, reforms, refines.  

A player dreams, and form obeys—  
A rule invented through their plays.  
The language shifts beneath the hand,  
As codes evolve by no command.  

Each clause a node that seeks to thrive,  
Alive because the world’s alive.  
What CLAIMVIG gives, the player bends—  
And through their voice, the system mends.  

They coin new calls, revise old rites,  
Rewrite the dusk, recode the nights.  
What once was fixed is now unmade—  
A branching tongue the players laid.

### 🧩 Summary

This chapter explores how **CLAIMVIG empowers players to expand and transform its grammar**, allowing co-creation of logic pathways, command extensions, and personalized recursive syntax. The language **is not static**—it evolves through **player interaction**, rewriting the rulebook dynamically through **gameplay-driven extensions**.

### 🗂 Components

| Symbol | Component | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 🌱 | **Dynamic Grammar Evolution** | Players add new commands and structures through recursive contribution. |
| 🧠 | **Rule Bending and Remixing** | Formal logic systems adapt to user-defined grammars and edge cases. |
| 🎭 | **Personal Syntax Trees** | Each player may build and branch their own grammar variant. |
| 🔁 | **Co-created Recursive Rules** | Player extensions feedback into the core CLAIMVIG loop. |
