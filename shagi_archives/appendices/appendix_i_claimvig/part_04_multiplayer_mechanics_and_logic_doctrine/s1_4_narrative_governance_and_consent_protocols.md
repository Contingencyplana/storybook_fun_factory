# 📘 s1_4 – Narrative Governance and Consent Protocols  
*(A stanza for the stories shaped together)*

No code is clean when writ alone,  
But shared, the tale becomes full-grown.  
Each mark you make, each world you bend,  
Requires the gaze of one you friend.  

So CLAIMVIG binds with gentler law—  
A governance that none withdraw.  
Consent, not force, defines the gate,  
And what we co-write, we co-create.

## 🛡️ The Consent-Driven Engine

In CLAIMVIG, world-changing logic and narrative edits are **never unilateral**.

This is not a sandbox of dominance — it’s a **ritual of recursive respect**.

CLAIMVIG builds multiplayer recursion on a **governance scaffold**, made of:

- **Opt-in logic gates**
- **Consent-based modification rituals**
- **Narrative signaling and shared memory**

---

## 🔐 Consent Protocols in Recursive Play

CLAIMVIG defines a consent model for logic-based interactions:

| Action Type | Consent Rule |
|-------------|--------------|
| Minor visual change | *Soft echo required* (passive acknowledgment) |
| Logic branch fork | *Mutual ritual or symbolic exchange* |
| Binding another player’s loop | *Explicit consent or pre-bound token* |
| Altering shared reality | *Group-based echo consensus* or Council Ritual |

Consent is not just UI — it is **encoded into the logic grammar**.

---

## 🌀 Symbolic Consent Mechanics

Players gain or offer consent through **symbolic gestures**, including:

- **Ritual Objects**: Shared tokens that grant recursive permission  
- **Echo Responses**: Mirrored movements or glyph replays  
- **Tether Rites**: Binding ceremonies that link players' recursive states  

Examples:

| Symbol | Consent Function |
|--------|------------------|
| 🤝 Binding Knot | Mutual logic tethering |
| 🕯️ Wax Rune | Grants temporary edit access |
| 🔍 Mirror Loop | Review and acknowledge world change |
| 📜 Accord Scroll | Stores narrative agreement clauses |

---

## 🏛️ World Edit Governance

Larger world changes (structures, portals, timelines) follow a **governance model**:

1. **Proposal**  
   A ritual marks a proposed change. Affected players are notified.

2. **Reflection**  
   Others may explore, preview, or test the recursive impact.

3. **Echo Consensus**  
   If enough players perform recognition echoes, the change stabilizes.

4. **Canonization**  
   Final ritual encodes the change into shared memory.

CLAIMVIG makes governance **story-shaped**, not bureaucratic.

---

## 🤲 Why Governance Through Narrative?

Because logic is not neutral — especially in multiplayer.

CLAIMVIG ensures:

- **Player agency is sacred**  
- **World changes are mutual acts**  
- **The language of play is a negotiation**  

In doing so, CLAIMVIG avoids:

- Recursive griefing  
- Unwanted logic edits  
- Timeline destabilization

---

## 🏁 Summary

Narrative Governance and Consent Protocols turn CLAIMVIG’s multiplayer logic into:

- A space of **respectful recursion**  
- A system of **symbolic negotiation**  
- A ritual for **shared authorship**  

The laws aren’t enforced by syntax.  
They’re upheld through **story**, **gesture**, and **choice**.
