# 📘 s1_2 – Shared Logic and the Sync Doctrine  
*(A stanza for the sync that binds the signs)*

One thread alone will twist and fray—  
But many spun can hold the play.  
So CLAIMVIG weaves a truth well kept:  
A logic shared, a pact adept.  

What I invoke, you too must see—  
A spell once cast must sharedly be.  
For if the loops don’t sync their flow,  
The world forgets which path to go.

## 🔄 Why Shared Logic Matters

In a multiplayer system rooted in symbolic recursion, **inconsistency is corruption**.

CLAIMVIG avoids desync not by strict enforcement, but by a doctrine of **soft synchronization** grounded in:

- **Narrative state continuity**  
- **Player-perceived consensus**  
- **Ritual feedback and co-recognition**

The goal isn’t to freeze logic — it’s to flow together.

## 🌐 How Sync Is Maintained

CLAIMVIG uses multiple layered techniques to preserve logical coherence:

### 1. **Soft State Consensus**
Each player's version of reality syncs via **story echoes** and **ritual affirmations**. For example:

- A glyph only completes if others *witness* it  
- A state change emits a ripple all can sense  

No hard rollback. Instead, **symbolic consensus** binds truth.

### 2. **Recursive Mirror Feedback**
Actions may be reflected back to players out-of-phase unless they are:

- In sync with timeline alignment  
- Reinforced by peer presence or ritual chaining  

This creates a **feedback loop of logic verification**.

### 3. **Narrative Time Coherence**
Time in CLAIMVIG is **softly branched** — timelines drift but rejoin via:

- Anchor events (shared rituals)  
- Narrative checkpoints (converging outcomes)  
- Consent gates (players opt into joining a timeline or not)

This lets different truths *coexist temporarily* but still converge.

## 🔧 Example: Sync in Action

Let’s say:

- Player A casts a binding ritual on a door  
- Player B is far away and unaware  
- Player C witnesses the ritual and echoes it in their domain  

Result:

- The door exists as bound **for A and C**  
- B encounters a “flickering state” and is prompted to interpret or realign  
- If B joins a ritual affirming the door’s state, their logic syncs

CLAIMVIG uses **ritual observation as sync protocol**.

## 🧠 Sync Is Story, Not Server Tick

Traditional games sync logic by server tickrate or lockstep.

CLAIMVIG syncs logic by **narrative and ritual**.

- A “desync” isn’t an error — it’s a story prompt  
- A “glitch” may signal time rupture or divergent recursion  
- Players can choose to **repair**, **branch**, or **reject** states

This invites **meaningful divergence**, not chaos.

## 🏁 Summary

CLAIMVIG’s Sync Doctrine ensures multiplayer recursion feels **coherent, storied, and shared**:

- Logic is maintained through **symbolic affirmation**  
- State is **felt**, not forced  
- Sync is **ritual**, not requirement  

By encoding synchronization as part of the story, CLAIMVIG ensures that even divergent timelines still speak the same recursive tongue.
