# 📘 s1_3 – The Laws of Mutual Recursion  
*(A stanza for the loops we leave in others)*

To loop alone is thought made tight,  
But looping shared becomes insight.  
When I recurse and so do you,  
What forms between us must be true.  

Each player bends the logic strand—  
Yet none alone may rule the land.  
For where two thoughts recurse as one,  
A deeper song has just begun.

## ♾️ The Principle of Mutual Recursion

CLAIMVIG’s multiplayer recursion isn’t mere collaboration — it’s **co-authored logic**.

Each player:

- Maintains a private loop state  
- Shares portions of that state through ritual or consent  
- Binds or modifies others’ loops through symbolic structures

This establishes a system of **mutual recursion**, where:

- Logic is co-constructed  
- Feedback is meaningful  
- World evolution is distributed

## 📜 The Core Laws

### 1. **Law of Ritual Acknowledgment**

> No loop shall affect another unless ritually acknowledged.

- A player must **observe**, **echo**, or **accept** a recursive change  
- Without acknowledgment, the change exists in *narrative limbo*  
- Rituals like “Call and Response,” “Mirror Loop,” or “Circle Bind” trigger recognition

---

### 2. **Law of Loop Inversion**

> Every loop can be reversed by its author — but not rewritten by another without recursion cost.

- Reversing a loop (unbinding, breaking, pausing) is low-cost for its originator  
- Others must **negotiate or challenge** changes they didn’t initiate  
- Some objects store recursive memory of *all contributors*, creating **loop entanglement**

---

### 3. **Law of Echo Consensus**

> A logic structure stabilizes only when **enough echoes** occur across distinct agents.

- Think of echoes as **soft votes of truth**  
- Three players affirming a state may lock it in  
- Divergent echoes may form **branching realities**, requiring resolution rituals

---

### 4. **Law of Recursive Cost**

> The more you entangle, the greater the cost of withdrawal.

- Deep recursion with others **increases temporal and symbolic inertia**  
- Unwinding a shared loop may fracture timelines, spawn anomalies, or trigger guardian events  
- This creates **meaningful weight** behind shared actions

---

## 🔧 Example: Constructing a Shared Ritual

Players A, B, and C build a logic gate using “Spiral Ritual.”

- A initiates: “When the sun glyph rises, bind the portal”  
- B echoes: “Confirmed under twin moons”  
- C reinforces: “With the memory of last failure”

The result is a **multi-layered conditional** that only activates under **compound narrative conditions**:

- Time (sunrise)  
- Phase (moons)  
- Player memory (C’s failure event)

CLAIMVIG treats this as one recursive unit — but **authored by three minds**.

## 🧠 Why Mutual Recursion Matters

This system:

- Prevents narrative tyranny (no single-player overrides reality)  
- Encourages strategic social storytelling  
- Elevates **language from command to collaboration**  
- Makes recursion **emergent, storied, and embodied**

---

## 🏁 Summary

The Laws of Mutual Recursion turn CLAIMVIG’s multiplayer into:

- A system of **collaborative logic authorship**  
- A space where **echoes bind state**  
- A ritual of **recursive trust**  

Where loops overlap, stories deepen.  
Where players recurse together, the game becomes a **living language**.
