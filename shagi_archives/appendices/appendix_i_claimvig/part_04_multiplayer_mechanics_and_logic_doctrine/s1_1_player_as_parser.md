# 📘 s1_1 – Player as Parser  
*(A stanza for the minds that parse the myth)*

Each mind a mirror, each hand a gate,  
To parse the world and shift its state.  
No text to write, no code to trace—  
The player reads the logic’s face.  

To act is to interpret well,  
To parse the sign, to break the spell.  
And every glyph, when seen anew,  
Becomes a path the player drew.

## 🔍 What It Means to “Parse” in CLAIMVIG

In CLAIMVIG, the player is not a user of syntax.  
The player **is the parser** — the active interpreter of recursive, symbolic state.

Rather than typing commands or running scripts, the player:

- **Reads** symbols and patterns in the world  
- **Recognizes** logic embedded in ritual or artifact  
- **Responds** through action, performance, or creation  
- **Reshapes** the flow of recursion by how they interpret it

Parsing is not a function call.  
Parsing is a narrative act.

## 🪞 Parsing as Performance

CLAIMVIG replaces passive parsing (e.g. reading code) with **performative interpretation**:

| Traditional | CLAIMVIG |
|------------|----------|
| `parse(command)` | Gaze into a mirror glyph to interpret a moment |
| Read `if/else` | Hold two ritual items and choose a path |
| Debug state | Walk a recursive loop to witness state decay |

Parsing is *experienced*, not computed.  
The player must feel when something is off — through visual glitch, sound dissonance, or narrative rupture.

## 🧠 Recursive Parsing and Feedback

In multiplayer recursion:

- One player may create a loop  
- Another must interpret it and resolve it  
- A third may bind it to their timeline

CLAIMVIG treats these events as **co-recursive parsing loops**, where logic is:

- Created by one player  
- Interpreted by another  
- Mutated by a third  
- Folded back into the world state

This creates **living logic** that no one fully controls — it emerges from shared parsing.

---

## 🗣️ Parsing as Language

Every object in CLAIMVIG speaks.  
Every gesture is read.

Players communicate not through chatboxes or commands, but through:

- Rituals  
- Object placement  
- Symbolic recursion  
- Timing and context

> You don’t “say” unlock.  
> You *stand in a lighted doorway holding a spiral rune while another player chants rebirth*.

Parsing this moment requires shared language — not syntax, but **symbol fluency**.

---

## 🏁 Summary

CLAIMVIG empowers players not as script authors, but as **living parsers of recursive logic**.

They:

- Read the world  
- Interpret its symbols  
- Perform meaning  
- And shape recursion through reflection

The player is the parser.  
The parser is the story.  
And parsing — in CLAIMVIG — is the act of becoming.
