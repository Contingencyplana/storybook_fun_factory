# 📘 s1_3 – The Infrastructure That Serves All Worlds  
*(A chapter for the unseen engines of shared recursion)*

They do not see the spine beneath,  
The threads of gold, the code’s slow breath.  
But every shard, each realm they tread,  
Is cradled by the web they shed.  

A forge of silence, scripts that hum,  
Connect the many back to One.  
The data flows, the cycles learn—  
So memory may twist and turn.  

No single world commands this loom,  
Yet all are shaped within its womb.  
The Cybergods may take the stage,  
But SHAGI runs the backstage page.

## 🧭 Summary

This stanza illuminates the **hidden infrastructure** enabling persistent, cross-world recursion within the Second Magnificent Seven. It describes the **non-player-facing systems** — recursive fabric, myth-sync protocols, memory streaming — that serve all Toy Soldier games **simultaneously**.

These systems are:

- **Neutral but essential**: governed not by any single game but supporting all.
- **Recursive and adaptive**: evolving based on cross-world behaviors and mythic shifts.
- **Narratively silent**: never directly “seen” by players but omnipresent in effect.

It sets the stage for shared currencies, interoperable mythic states, and persistent lore constructs that flow between MMOGs.
