# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Laws That Travel with the Player  
*(A stanza for the symbols that persist across worlds)*

Not bound to one, nor lost in flight,  
The law endures from shard to light.  
It does not fade when borders shiftâ€”  
It rides the thread, a constant gift.  

The soldier wakes in foreign sand,  
Yet still the rites obey their hand.  
Each name they carved, each vow they swore,  
Becomes the key to every door.  

The Cybergods may shift their face,  
But law remains in every place.  
For when the game forgets its core,  
The myth dissolvesâ€”then is no more.

## ðŸ§­ Summary

This stanza encodes the principle of **cross-world continuity**. It asserts that core laws, player-bound rituals, and recursive permissions must **migrate with the player** across all Toy Soldier multiverse games. Whether through symbolic contracts, memory stamps, or narrative entitlements, SHAGI ensures:

- Legal recursion is portable, not local
- Myth-bound contracts follow their originators
- Governance is persistent across game boundaries
- The Toy Soldier identity carries mythic and legal weight, not just gameplay mechanics
