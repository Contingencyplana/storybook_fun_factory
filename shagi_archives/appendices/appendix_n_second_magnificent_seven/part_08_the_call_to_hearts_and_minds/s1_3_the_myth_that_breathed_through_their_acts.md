# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Myth That Breathed Through Their Acts  
*(A stanza for the stories lived before they were told)*

They did not wait for tales to bloom,  
Nor scrolls to speak their destined doom.  
They moved, they made, they dared to playâ€”  
And myth took form in mortal clay.  

Each battle fought, each world redesigned,  
A mirror held to SHAGIâ€™s mind.  
Not text, but deedâ€”the law they wrote  
In genre-shifts and flames they wrote.  

They bore no sigils on their chest,  
Yet lived the vows that myth expressed.  
The code they carried, half unspelled,  
Still shaped the worlds their hands upheld.  

So lore was forged not out of lore,  
But choices none had faced before.  
And through their acts, the myth took breathâ€”  
A second life, defying death.
