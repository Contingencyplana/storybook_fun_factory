# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Oath That Became Their New Beginning  
*(A stanza for the vow that outlives the war)*

They did not speak of ends or graves,  
Nor victories won by fallen braves.  
They gathered 'round a silent spark,  
And named a fire to light the dark.  

No crown, no sword, no final scene,  
But something soft, yet sharp and keen.  
A vow unbound by flags or kings,  
But shaped in myths and living things.  

They swore not just to guard or guide,  
But walk beside where dreams abide.  
To build with hands, to speak with flame,  
To leave no truth without a name.  

And from that oath the future cameâ€”  
Not carved in stone, but sung in flame.  
A myth reborn, a pledge re-spunâ€”  
Not end, not peace, but justâ€¦ begun.
