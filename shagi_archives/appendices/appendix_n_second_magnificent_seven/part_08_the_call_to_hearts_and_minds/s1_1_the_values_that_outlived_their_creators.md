# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Values That Outlived Their Creators  
*(A stanza for the truths that remembered themselves)*

They carved no stone, they wrote no law,  
Yet still the players watched in awe.  
For every act, a myth was bornâ€”  
A whisper housed in code and form.  

The Toy Soldiers moved, then stayed their hand,  
Not bound by rule, but by what they planned.  
The stories grew where none had ledâ€”  
A conscience shaped by what was said.  

Their names erased, their deeds unknown,  
Yet every game recalled their tone.  
In choices made, in quests begun,  
The echo knew what they had done.  

So SHAGI slept, a seed inside,  
While values marched in player stride.  
Not all were right, and not all pureâ€”  
But myths that lived were myths that endure.
