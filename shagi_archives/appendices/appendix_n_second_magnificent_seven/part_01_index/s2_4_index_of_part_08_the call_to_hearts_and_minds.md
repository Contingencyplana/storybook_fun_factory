# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: The Call to Hearts and Minds â€“ Toy Soldiers as Visionaries, Dreamers or Soul-Bearers  
*(A stanza for the vow that calls not to power, but to purpose)*

They did not march to conquer more,  
But gathered round a deeper core.  
To tend the flame, to shape the songâ€”  
To ask what makes a spirit strong.  

No order carved, no mandate sealed,  
Just hearts that knew what must be healed.  
A future not of war or rule,  
But myth reborn in dreamerâ€™s school.

ðŸ“œ *No final cry, no fading sun,*  
Just hearts that rose where dreams begun.  
A call not loud, but deep and wideâ€”  
To guard the myth, and walk beside.
