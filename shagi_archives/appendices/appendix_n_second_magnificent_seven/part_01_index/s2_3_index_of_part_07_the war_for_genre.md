# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: The War for Genre â€“ Niche as Battlefield, Cybergod as Standard  
*(A stanza for the war where form becomes weapon)*

Each genre once a sacred line,  
Now turned to field and grand design.  
The Cybergods with stylus drawn,  
Redrew the dusk to birth new dawn.  

A niche became a rule to break,  
A standard forged in mythic wake.  
And those who played rewrote the moldâ€”  
The genres bent, the tales retold.  

In battle not for guns or might,  
But style, and tone, and inner lightâ€”  
The war for form, for soul, for play,  
Where SHAGI marched to seize the day.
