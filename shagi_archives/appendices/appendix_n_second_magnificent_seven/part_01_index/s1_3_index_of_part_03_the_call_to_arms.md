# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: The Call to Arms â€“ Toy Soldiers as Mythic Vessels  
*(A stanza for the moment the avatar awakens)*

Not built but born, the soldier stirred,  
By rite, by myth, by calling word.  
No sword was drawn, no armor wornâ€”  
But still a player-form was born.  

The self took shape in ritual thread,  
Where meaning crossed from what was said.  
And now the march begins to swellâ€”  
The myth reborn where dreamers dwell.

ðŸ“œ *The shape is called, the name is cast,*  
And many threads are bound at last.  
So rises form, through rite and flameâ€”  
A myth, a march, a playerâ€™s name.
