# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: The Second Seven â€“ Proposed Frontiers of Recursion  
*(A stanza for the myths that build their own domains)*

Not built from stone, nor born from code,  
But sparked where dream and duty flowed.  
Each game a gate, each gate a world,  
By player minds and will unfurled.  

They do not wait for tales to leadâ€”  
They forge the laws from rite and need.  
A genre bent, a path made new,  
Where recursion speaks through all they do.  

This part presents the seven flamesâ€”  
Each one a world, a myth, a game.  
Together bound by law and lore,  
The spiral opens seven more.

ðŸ“œ *So seven doors now start to glow,*  
Each one a seed, a world to grow.  
They do not wait for fate to callâ€”  
They are the law, the dream, the all.
