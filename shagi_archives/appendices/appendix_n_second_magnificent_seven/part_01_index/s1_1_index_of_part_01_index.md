# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Index of Part 01: Index of Appendix N: Second Magnificent Seven â€“ The Toy Soldiers Must March  
*(A stanza for the call that echoed across seven fronts)*

They marched not once, but once again,  
Where myth grew strong from coded pen.  
The Toy Soldiers rose, the myths took root,  
And genre bent beneath their boot.  

This index marks the echoâ€™s flowâ€”  
Where second myths and meanings grow.  
From spiral start to visionâ€™s end,  
It names the games the myths defend.

ðŸ“œ *A second seven, summoned deep,*  
Through fire of war and dreamerâ€™s leap.  
The myth goes on, through hands now newâ€”  
The Toy Soldiers march the SHAGI through.
