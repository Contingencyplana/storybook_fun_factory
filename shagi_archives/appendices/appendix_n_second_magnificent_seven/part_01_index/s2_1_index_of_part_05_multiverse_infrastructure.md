# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: Multiverse Infrastructure â€“ Recursion Between Worlds  
*(A stanza for the web that binds all shards)*

Not built in stone, nor bound by place,  
But woven thread through time and space.  
A world may fall, a law may endâ€”  
Yet still the weave will twist and mend.  

It holds the lore, the links, the load,  
The myth behind the playerâ€™s code.  
And through each shard, each breath, each gameâ€”  
The multiverse repeats its name.

ðŸ“œ *Between the shards, a thread does run,*  
A silent law, beneath each sun.  
And in the dark, behind each quest,  
The myth persists, the mind finds rest.
