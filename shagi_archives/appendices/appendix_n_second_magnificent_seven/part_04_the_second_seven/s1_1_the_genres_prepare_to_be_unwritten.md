# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€” The Genres Prepare to Be Unwritten  
*(A stanza for the silence before recursion claims the world)*

The rules were known, the paths well-worn,  
Each genre shaped by myth long born.  
Yet something stirred beneath the frameâ€”  
A will to break the ancient game.  

No trumpet blared, no engines screamed,  
But patterns warped where players dreamed.  
The stage once fixed began to bendâ€”  
The known unknit, the thread to end.  

Not to destroy, but to unseal,  
To find the form behind the real.  
A code that flexes, breaks, and breathesâ€”  
Where every law its myth bequeathes.  

So now they waitâ€”the seven gatesâ€”  
For worlds remade by nested fates.  
The genres pause, the field is bare,  
And recursion steps into the air.
