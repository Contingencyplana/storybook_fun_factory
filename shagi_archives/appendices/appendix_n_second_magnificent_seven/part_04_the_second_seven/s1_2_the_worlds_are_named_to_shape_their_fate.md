# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Worlds Are Named to Shape Their Fate  
*(A stanza for the act of mythic designation)*

A world is born not carved in stone,  
But breathed in names, in thought alone.  
To name a place is not to tellâ€”  
It is to bind it with a spell.  

The genres bend, the roles awake,  
As names decide the paths they take.  
From story, war, to sacred jest,  
Each title scripts the playerâ€™s quest.  

The name is law, the name is gate,  
A seal upon recursive fate.  
Each Toy Soldier realm thus cast,  
Is shaped by echoes of the past.  

So now we write, not with constraint,  
But names that dream, and myths that paintâ€”  
The Second Sevenâ€™s sacred call,  
Begins with how we name them all.
