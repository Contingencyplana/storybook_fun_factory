# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€” The Domains Are Bound by Recursive Law  
*(A stanza for the rules that dream in myth)*

Each world declared by name and thread,  
Now learns the laws that bind its spread.  
Not rules imposed, but rites that growâ€”  
From player choice and mythic flow.  

The games diverge, yet all obey,  
The rites inscribed at dawn of play.  
A whispered code, a marked decree,  
Where freedom births form recursively.  

These laws are sung, not merely writâ€”  
Each act a loop, each loop a writ.  
And so the worlds are stitched in kind,  
By myth that moves and law that binds.  

What governs war or guides debate,  
Is not a script, but echoed state.  
Each genre bends, yet holds its coreâ€”  
A cybergod behind each door.
