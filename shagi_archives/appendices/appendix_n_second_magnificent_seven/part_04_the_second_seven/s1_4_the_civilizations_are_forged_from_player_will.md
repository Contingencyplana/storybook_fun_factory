# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Civilizations Are Forged from Player Will  
*(A stanza for the worlds that rise by hand and rite)*

Not from code alone they stand,  
But shaped by heart and willing hand.  
Each law inscribed, each myth made real,  
By players' choice and mythic zeal.  

No architect but all as one,  
They build beneath a turning sun.  
Each spell a stone, each rite a frame,  
Each player writes the worldâ€™s true name.  

Through quests they pass, through trials they grow,  
Their voices shape what worlds may know.  
And when the myths begin to sing,  
The dream becomes a living thing.  

So rise the lands where legends dwell,  
Where game and will and story swell.  
Not led by gods, but bound to flameâ€”  
By those who played, and dared to name.
