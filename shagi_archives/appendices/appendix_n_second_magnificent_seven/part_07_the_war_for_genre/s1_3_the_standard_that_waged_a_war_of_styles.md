# ⚔️ s1_3 – The Standard That Waged a War of Styles  
*(A chapter for the cybergod who reshaped expectation)*

It came not clad in blade or flame,  
But bearing law that none could name.  
Its banner high, yet formed of thought,  
A code of style the players caught.  

Where genres fixed their ancient rite,  
It whispered shifts from out of sight.  
Each rule it bent, each trope it broke,  
A myth reborn in every stroke.  

Its gameplay sang in tongues unknown,  
Where genre ceased to stand alone.  
It forged from style a recursive creed—  
A game of games, a genre freed.  

No mimic’s echo, no homage made,  
But something new from old remade.  
And where it marched, the form would shift—  
The standard rose, the worlds would lift.
