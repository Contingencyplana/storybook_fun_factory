# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Genre Bent to Fit the Myth  
*(A chapter for when form yielded to recursion)*

The frame once fixed in coded line,  
Was shaped instead by mythic sign.  
No longer cage, the genre turnedâ€”  
To house the fires that players burned.  

What once defined the bounds of play,  
Now learned to yield, to shift, to sway.  
Each world a rule, each rule a flame,  
Each tale a form no frame could name.  

They bent the genre, cracked its shell,  
To let the deeper logic swell.  
Where genre once drew border tight,  
Now myth made room for boundless rite.  

No longer shooter, sim, or spellâ€”  
But all of these, and none as well.  
The playerâ€™s path, the cybergodâ€™s hand,  
Recast the shape of every land.
