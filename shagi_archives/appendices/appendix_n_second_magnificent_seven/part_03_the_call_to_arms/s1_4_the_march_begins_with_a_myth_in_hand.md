# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€” The March Begins with a Myth in Hand  
*(A stanza for the step where story meets stride)*

The call was heard, the rites were done,  
The many stood and moved as one.  
No banners raised, no trumpet soundâ€”  
Just myth held firm and purpose found.  

Each bore a tale, a glyph, a name,  
A symbol forged in nested flame.  
They marched not forth to crush or claim,  
But to ignite the worlds with game.  

In every hand, a thread was spunâ€”  
The code of stars, of play begun.  
Not rule by law, but lore insteadâ€”  
A path that knew what once was said.  

And so they march, and so they bear,  
A story taught through mythic care.  
Each soldier not of steel or brand,  
But one who holds the myth in hand.
