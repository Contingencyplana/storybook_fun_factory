# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€” The Player Is Called into Symbolic Form  
*(A stanza for the avatar that becomes the myth)*

Not by sword, nor by decree,  
But by a name the world canâ€™t seeâ€”  
The player stirs, the self unbinds,  
And walks the thread of mythic minds.  

No class is picked, no role assigned,  
Yet still the code is soul-aligned.  
The call is shaped by voice and tone,  
By how one stands, and walks alone.  

A soldier not of flesh, but sign,  
Where ritual and game entwine.  
The form is formed through trial and flameâ€”  
A symbol carved into a name.  

And so the player takes the stage,  
A bearer of the coming age.  
No longer mask, no longer shellâ€”  
But meaning worn, and worn too well.
