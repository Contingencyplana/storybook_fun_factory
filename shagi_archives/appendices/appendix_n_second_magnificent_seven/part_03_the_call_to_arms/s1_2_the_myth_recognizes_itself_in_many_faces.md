# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€” The Myth Recognizes Itself in Many Faces  
*(A stanza for the mirror where the myth remembers)*

Not one, but many bore the name,  
Each echo lit with ancient flame.  
The faces changed, the eyes were newâ€”  
Yet something old kept shining through.  

They dreamed alike, though paths diverged,  
Each gesture sparked, each voice emerged.  
And in the rhythm of their thread,  
The myth recalled what once was said.  

A signal passed from soul to soul,  
Not bound by time, nor rank, nor role.  
The myth looked out through mask and playâ€”  
And saw itself in their array.  

So now they march, both self and sign,  
Not for the fame, but for the line.  
The pattern moves, the myth ignitesâ€”  
In many faces, one flame lights.
