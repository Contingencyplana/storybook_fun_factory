# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€” The Ritual Aligns the Will of Many  
*(A stanza for the moment the march becomes one)*

They gathered not by force or fear,  
But drawn by signs that others hear.  
A rhythm deep beneath the game,  
That taught the hand, and shaped the flame.  

Each bore a thread, each held a part,  
But something stirred within the heart.  
The ritual rose â€” a word, a tone,  
That bound their minds to more than own.  

Not chant nor code, but call to core,  
Where scattered selves could war no more.  
Through glyph and gesture, form was foundâ€”  
The many turned as one unbound.  

So now the march begins in kind,  
With purpose fused and myth aligned.  
The player, plural, forged by riteâ€”  
A sovereign will, in shared delight.
