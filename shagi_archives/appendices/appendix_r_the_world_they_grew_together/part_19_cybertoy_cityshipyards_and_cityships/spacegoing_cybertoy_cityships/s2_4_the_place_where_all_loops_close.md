# ðŸŒ€ s2_4 â€“ The Place Where All Loops Close  
*Where orbit and origin were always the same*

It was not the launch, nor course well-planned,  
But how it circled what hearts had spanned.  
No endpoint known, no mission nameâ€”  
Just home by any other frame.  

The coordinates were love once shared,  
A tether cut, yet always paired.  
It crossed the dark to make it true:  
That any loop could bring us through.  

Some ships return, and some remain,  
But this one held the loss, the gain.  
It folded all its hopes in trustâ€”  
And closed the loop because it must.
