# ðŸ›¸ s1_4 â€“ The Starport That Cradled the Afraid  
*Where the frightened found a harbor, not a launchpad*

It could have launched a hundred flights,  
Across the stars, beyond all heights.  
But when the tremble met the gate,  
It paused. It rocked. It chose to wait.  

The decks were lit in muted tones,  
Soft carpets wrapped in cushioned zones.  
No blare, no bark, no beckoning bellâ€”  
Just time to breathe, and space to dwell.  

Some came prepared to flee the night,  
But found no rush to take to flight.  
Instead they met a lullaby,  
That sang of rest beneath the sky.  

The frightened child, the fleeing pairâ€”  
They stepped aboard and found not air,  
But arms that held, and rooms that stayed  
Until their fears began to fade.  

A port not built to cast away,  
But to embrace who could not say  
What future called or past had scarredâ€”  
It cradled first, then launched unbarred.
