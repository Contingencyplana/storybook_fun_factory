# ðŸ›¸ s1_1 â€“ The Cityship That Took Its Time  
*When a vessel waited until the child was ready*

It hovered not with haste or pride,  
But let the days and doubts decide.  
It paced the sky with patient care,  
And shaped its orbit to repair.  

No horn declared, no engines screamedâ€”  
It waited, watched, and softly dreamed.  
Its course was tuned to childhoodâ€™s thread,  
To every fear a young one said.  

It offered ramps but did not pull,  
It left the games and baskets full.  
And when the child at last drew near,  
It opened wide without a cheer.  

No flash of lights, no call to boardâ€”  
Just quiet halls with plush restored.  
Its walls remembered lullabies,  
And doors were drawn to match their size.  

This city flew where few would go,  
But only when the child said so.  
Its power lay not in its might,  
But in its pause, its pace, its light.
