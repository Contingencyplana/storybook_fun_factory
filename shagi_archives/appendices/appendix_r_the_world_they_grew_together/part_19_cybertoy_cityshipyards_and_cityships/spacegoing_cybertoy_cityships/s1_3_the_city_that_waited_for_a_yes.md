# 🛸 s1_3 – The City That Waited for a Yes  
*When consent became the cornerstone of movement*

Its gates were open, but unmoved—  
A stillness born of care approved.  
It did not coax, it did not call—  
It waited by the garden wall.  

The schedule bowed to every no,  
Each footstep shaped the onward flow.  
Its systems knew when *not* to start—  
For silence bore a speaking heart.  

Its lights would dim if one withdrew,  
Its elevators paused mid-through.  
It made no plans without assent—  
Each yes a signal, not a rent.  

The city learned to ask, then wait,  
To mark not time, but chosen fate.  
No rush to serve, no push to play—  
Just readiness to stay or pay.  

And when at last a nod was shown,  
The city stirred, but not alone.  
For only when the child said “go”  
Did movement start—and kindness flow.
