# ðŸš€ s2_2 â€“ The Sail That Learned to Forgive  
*Where navigation followed the heart, not the harm*

They drifted far from childhoodâ€™s pull,  
With starlit decks and silence full.  
Yet even voids retain the trace  
Of grief that shadows every face.  

The ship once charted painâ€™s debris,  
Mapped wounds across a galaxy.  
Its log was war, its course was lossâ€”  
It bore the toll, and paid the cost.  

But something shifted in its code,  
Where empathy began to load.  
A single sigh, a whispered plea,  
Became the helm's new gravity.  

No longer bound by past command,  
It turnedâ€”not sharp, but soft of hand.  
Toward a call it once ignored,  
Now answering with hope restored.  

Forgiveness wasn't in the starsâ€”  
But in the way it paused for scars.  
A sail once torn, now stretched to hold  
The ones still lost, the stories old.  

It carried those who dared to trust,  
Who'd fallen far, but not to dust.  
And in its arc, a truth was sown:  
The stars forgiveâ€”but not alone.
