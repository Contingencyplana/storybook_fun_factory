# 🪐 s2_1 – The Cityship That Brought Them Home  

*Where arrival meant remembrance, not return*

It waited where the sky grew thin,  
A memory stitched in orbital skin.  
Not to retrieve, but to remind—  
A home that knew what you left behind.  

Its panels hummed a softened tone,  
Not beacon-blare, but welcome known.  
Its gravity—a gentle hand  
That taught the stars to understand.  

It opened wide, but did not plead,  
It answered not demand, but need.  
Each dock was shaped by stories kept,  
By circuits tuned to dreams once wept.  

It did not ask what they had done,  
Or where they fled, or what they'd won.  
It only asked if they still knew—  
The path back home is always true.  

So here they landed, not to claim,  
But to be named by love, not fame.  
No final gate, no distant dome—  
Just one last line: *You’re always home.*
