# ðŸ›¸ s1_2 â€“ The Vessel That Listened Instead of Led  
*When command deferred to care*

It charted not the stars ahead,  
But tuned its maps to words unsaid.  
Each sigh became a course to plot,  
Each silence marked a needed spot.  

Its helm was voice, its rudder trust,  
Its engines paused if pushed or fussed.  
No order rang, no mission barkedâ€”  
Just murmurs where the quiet sparked.  

When passengers could not explain  
What shaped their joy, or grief, or pain,  
The ship would slow, then start againâ€”  
As if the pause itself was plain.  

Its floors would tilt to where they leaned,  
Its lights would dim where sorrow keened.  
And in that hush, a bond would bloomâ€”  
A vessel wide enough for room.  

It led not by the strength of will,  
But by the art of standing still.  
Not every ship must chart aheadâ€”  
Some make the space for hearts instead.
