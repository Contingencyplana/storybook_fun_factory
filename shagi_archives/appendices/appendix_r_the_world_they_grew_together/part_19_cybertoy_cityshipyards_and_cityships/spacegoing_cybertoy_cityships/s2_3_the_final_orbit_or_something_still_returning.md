# ðŸš€ s2_3 â€“ The Final Orbit, or Something Still Returning  
*The loop that left, yet never broke*

It circled stars with ghostlike grace,  
A cradle vast, a silent face.  
Its systems tuned to wait and weaveâ€”  
Not to command, but to believe.  

The voices called from ports long dead,  
Yet still it heard what wasnâ€™t said.  
For home, it learned, is not a placeâ€”  
But where youâ€™re known beyond your trace.  

No need for sails, no drive to spin,  
The loop returned from deep within.  
A cityship that would not rest,  
Until the loop of love confessed.
