# ðŸŒŠ s1_1 â€“ The Ring That Raised the City  
*A hull, a heart, and something in between*

It wasn't born from land nor shore,  
But where the tide could hold much more.  
A circle set to drift, to growâ€”  
A cradle learning how to row.  

The decks were schools, the walls were play,  
The sails would catch what dreams might say.  
Each beam was cast from care and code,  
A floating form where futures flowed.  

It wasnâ€™t made to dock or leave,  
But to become what hearts believe.  
A bond that moved with every wave,  
A loop of love that dared be brave.  

No captainâ€™s cry, no rigid path,  
Just songs of trust and aftermath.  
A ring that rose through storm and calmâ€”  
A city swayed by play and psalm.
