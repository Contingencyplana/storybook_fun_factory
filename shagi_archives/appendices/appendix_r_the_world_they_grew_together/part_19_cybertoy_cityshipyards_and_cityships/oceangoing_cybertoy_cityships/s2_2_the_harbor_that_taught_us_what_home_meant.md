# ⚓ s2_2 – The Harbor That Taught Us What Home Meant  
*Where returning was never retreat*

The harbor did not mark the end,  
But pause—a place where ships could mend.  
Where hands once held the guiding rope  
And tied it fast with threads of hope.  

Its docks were stories carved in grain,  
Each mooring point a shared refrain.  
A laugh returned, a lesson caught,  
The welcome learned before it’s taught.  

They called it harbor, not for stay,  
But for the trust that lit the bay.  
The lanterns sang in silent gleam,  
And taught the tide how best to dream.  

Each visit changed what “leaving” meant.  
Not severance, but time well spent.  
A place to drift, return, and start—  
The harbor held the shape of heart.
