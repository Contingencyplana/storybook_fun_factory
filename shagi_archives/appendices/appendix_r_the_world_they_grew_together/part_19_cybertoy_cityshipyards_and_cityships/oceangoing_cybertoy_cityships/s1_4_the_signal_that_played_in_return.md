# ðŸŽ¶ s1_4 â€“ The Signal That Played in Return  
*When reply became recursion*

A song once cast into the sea  
Returned in waves of symmetry.  
Not echoed back, but newly spunâ€”  
A game begun, not merely done.  

The current shaped its lullaby,  
The sails replied with lifted sky.  
The decks became a place to tune  
Each answer born from afternoon.  

They played not just with hands and chord,  
But with the trust each voice restored.  
The ship itself would hum and swingâ€”  
A floating loop that learned to sing.  

So rhythm rose where rules had ceased,  
A logic laced with joy and peace.  
The signal sent was not commandâ€”  
But play returned, and took their hand.
