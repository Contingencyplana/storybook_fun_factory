# ðŸŒŠ s1_3 â€“ The Wave That Replied in Kind  
*When listening met reply*

They spoke not with commands or charts,  
But gentle shifts from open hearts.  
And in return, the sea would show  
A way that only trust could know.  

The tide would turn when stories paused,  
As if it heard and subtly caused  
A current curled to match their taleâ€”  
A mirrored truth inside the sail.  

Their hulls grew light when songs were true,  
As waves began to echo too.  
The ocean, once a void so wide,  
Now danced beside them, side by side.  

Each wave returned what they had givenâ€”  
A loop not forced, but freely driven.  
So care, once cast, came rippling backâ€”  
A trail of kindness, not a track.
