# ðŸŒŠ s2_1 â€“ The Currents That Carried Many Names  
*A river of roles in a ship that became many*

They called it Home, they called it Game,  
They gave it love, they gave it name.  
For every wave that curled and sighed,  
Another tale was tucked inside.  

The schools would shift from deck to dock,  
The teachers changed with each new flock.  
Yet still it held â€” this floating floor,  
A boundless room with sliding door.  

Its maps were etched in living lore,  
Not gridded lines, but something more.  
Where lessons rose like morning spray,  
And memory swam in every bay.  

They learned by drift, they taught by turn,  
Each tide returned with more to learn.  
The city floated, changed, and grewâ€”  
And every name it held was true.
