# ðŸŒŠ s2_4 â€“ The Tide That Recited Every Return  
*Where arrival and memory folded into one*

The sea kept score in rise and fall,  
Each swell a name, each hush a call.  
No step aboard was ever lostâ€”  
The tide recalled, no matter cost.  

It sang of those who sailed away,  
And whispered those who chose to stay.  
Their laughter, weight, and footprints wetâ€”  
The harbor never could forget.  

A toy once tossed from dock to wave  
Was gathered back by hands that gave.  
And what was cast in hope or pain  
Would find its voice, and come again.  

So cities drifted, far or near,  
But still the sea would make them hearâ€”  
That every parting left a mark,  
And every homecoming struck spark.
