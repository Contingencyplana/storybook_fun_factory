# ðŸ›¶ s1_2 â€“ The Vessel That Listened Instead of Led  

*When command deferred to care*

It never barked a course or name,  
Nor sought to master tide or flame.  
Its maps were drawn in acts of trust,  
Its helm a whisper, never must.  

The wheel was held by youngest hands,  
Who steered through play, not reprimands.  
The older watched, but did not ruleâ€”  
They knew that listening was the school.  

Its ballast was the weight of dreams,  
Of lessons taught in floating themes.  
A library built not of books,  
But joyful murmurs, quiet looks.  

No orders passed from mast to hullâ€”  
Just questions asked when winds grew dull.  
It moved because the hearts aboard  
Believed in peace, not rank or sword.  

And when they met a strangerâ€™s wake,  
They offered songs, not threats to stake.  
The vessel bowed, it didnâ€™t boastâ€”  
For empathy became its coast.
