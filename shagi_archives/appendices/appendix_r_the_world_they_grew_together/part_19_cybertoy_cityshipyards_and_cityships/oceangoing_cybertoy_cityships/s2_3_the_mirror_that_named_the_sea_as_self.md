# 🌊 s2_3 – The Mirror That Named the Sea as Self  
*Where they learned the ocean by knowing their own reflection*

The sea looked back and saw a face—  
Not stranger’s glare, but kindred grace.  
Its tides replied in pulse and tone,  
To teach the ship what was its own.  

Reflections danced on every swell,  
And whispered truths too deep to tell.  
A bow, a breeze, a thought set free—  
All echoed through identity.  

They named the waves not “enemy,”  
But "we"—a kind of symmetry.  
A mirrored world, a mirrored mind,  
That learned to drift and still be kind.  

The cityship grew soft and wise,  
A lighthouse shaped from lullabies.  
And those who looked into the blue  
Found something still—and someone true.
