# 🪵 s1_3 – The Beam That Bore Their Promises Forward  
*The pledge in every plank*

Each beam they raised was more than wood—  
It held the oath: “We’ll do what’s good.”  
Not signed or stamped in ink or gold,  
But grained in grain, and shaped to hold.  

Before it met the tide or sky,  
The frame would learn the reasons why.  
For every joint and fitted brace  
Was pledged to serve—not just displace.  

No shortcut saved them time or cost,  
If trust, not speed, was what they’d lost.  
They bore their promises in pine,  
And made each splice a sacred line.  

So through the beam, their vow would sail—  
Not just to float, but to prevail.  
For hearts could rest in craft well-poured—  
Their futures cradled, promise-stored.
