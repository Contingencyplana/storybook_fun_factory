# ðŸ§­ s1_4 â€“ The Keel That Knew Which Way Was Home  
*The axis beneath every return*

They placed the keel with hands held low,  
As if the sea already knew.  
It wasnâ€™t drawn on star or chartâ€”  
But bent around the buildersâ€™ heart.  

It pointed not to north or port,  
But to the place where kin consort.  
Where lullabies could find their tune,  
And every dusk would greet the moon.  

The hull would drift, the mast might turn,  
But still the keel would feel and learn.  
It kept the path through dark and foam,  
By knowing not the wayâ€”but *home*.  

So every ship that left that dock  
Returned in time, or tale, or talk.  
For even vessels lost in storm  
Would dream again of where theyâ€™re warm.
