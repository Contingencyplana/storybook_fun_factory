# 🛠️ s1_1 – The Hull That Learned to Hold a Heart  
*Where shipwrights drafted tenderness*

They built not just for wind and tide,  
But for the souls that dwelled inside.  
Each plank was placed with dreams in mind—  
A frame for futures, soft and kind.  

No steel was laid without a song,  
No beam unblessed where hearts belong.  
The yards were quiet, save for care—  
Each hammerfall a silent prayer.  

It wasn’t speed they prized the most,  
But whether trust would ride each post.  
A cradle carved from shared intent—  
A harbor made of what they meant.  

So hulls were born not hard, but true—  
A vessel shaped by point of view.  
And every brace and every seam  
Was built to hold not weight, but dream.
