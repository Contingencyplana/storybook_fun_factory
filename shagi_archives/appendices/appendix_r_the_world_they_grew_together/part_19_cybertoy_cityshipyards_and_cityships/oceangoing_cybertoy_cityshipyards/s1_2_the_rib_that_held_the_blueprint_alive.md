# 🧱 s1_2 – The Rib That Held the Blueprint Alive  
*Where structure remembered the soul*

It wasn’t etched on page or stone,  
But passed through hands and heart alone.  
A rib of knowledge, gently kept—  
Through every joint, tradition wept.  

Not stored in vault or master plan,  
But whispered soft from hand to hand.  
Each craftsperson who joined the line  
Inhaled intent, exhaled design.  

They built with care, but more with lore—  
What came before, and what was for.  
The rib they traced with reverent touch  
Held not just “how,” but also “much.”  

For in that arc, they’d come to see  
That making ships was memory.  
And every spar they raised anew  
Held what the last had dared and knew.
