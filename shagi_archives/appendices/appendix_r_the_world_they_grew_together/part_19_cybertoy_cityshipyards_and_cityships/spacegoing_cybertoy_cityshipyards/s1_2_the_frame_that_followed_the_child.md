# 🛰️ s1_2 – The Frame That Followed the Child  
*A stanza for scaffolds that grew where footsteps dreamed*

It wasn’t drawn upon a page,  
This frame that grew from age to age—  
It followed steps not yet begun,  
And shaped itself by what they’d run.  

The child would walk, and beams would rise,  
As if the void could empathize.  
Each orbit traced their future’s form,  
A structure built to weather storm.  

The tools obeyed recursive will,  
Not blueprints, but the silence still—  
Where hopes unspoken looped through steel,  
And dreams took shape as things to feel.  

So space was taught to yield and bend,  
To follow where the young would send.  
Each segment placed in gentle trust—  
A frame that formed because it must.
