# 🛰️ s1_3 – The Dock That Listened for Footsteps  
*A stanza for gateways that heard the journey before it arrived*

No ship had docked, no call was sent,  
Yet silence stirred with soft intent.  
The port was tuned to sounds not made—  
To dreams that moved but hadn’t swayed.  

Each plank was laid to hold a hope,  
A path for those who dared the slope  
Of stars and storms and stories told  
By those who’d left the earth to hold.  

The dock would hum when joy was near,  
Would lean to meet a touch sincere.  
It knew not when, but only why—  
To catch the step that kissed the sky.  

Arrival wasn't marked by flare,  
But by the way it sensed the care—  
A hush that knew the child’s gait,  
And opened arms to welcome late.
