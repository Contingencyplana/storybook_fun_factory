# ðŸŒŒ s1_1 â€“ The Ring That Raised the City  
*A stanza for orbital hands that held a city's dream*

They did not build from ground to spireâ€”  
They launched the roots, then lit the wire.  
The hulls were hoisted first by trust,  
Then sealed with stars, not soil or dust.  

A ring in orbit, scaffold-born,  
Where night and morning mixed with dawn.  
Each bolt a promise, beam a bond,  
Each weld a wish they gazed beyond.  

No child had walked these decks before,  
Yet every plank knew what they swore:  
To raise a place not just to dwell,  
But one that heard the silent swell.  

And when the ring began to hum,  
It echoed all they still would become.  
The cityâ€™s start was not a groundâ€”  
But orbitâ€™s arms that looped around.
