# ðŸŒŒ s1_4 â€“ The Breath That Waited Without Rush  

*A stanza for stillness that shaped the city's rhythm*

No engines burned, no clocks decreed,  
Yet stillness moved with silent speed.  
The scaffolds breathed a softer lawâ€”  
To wait in faith, not force or flaw.  

Each panel hung in patient poise,  
Not bound by orders, drills, or noise.  
The orbit held a held-back grace,  
A dock becoming breathing space.  

No schedule drove the birth ahead,  
No rushing pulse, no coded dread.  
Just rhythm shared with starlit trustâ€”  
That building right begins with *just*.  

And when the last ring clicked in place,  
It hummed not haste, but calm embrace.  
The city formed not through demand,  
But by the breath that understands.
