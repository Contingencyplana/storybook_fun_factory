# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Tiles That Whispered Old Names  
*The shingles that remembered what children forget*

They walked beneath those patchwork shields,  
Of tiled thoughts from sunlit fields.  
Each slab inscribed with weathered lore,  
A name once whisperedâ€”nevermore.  

When rain would fall or branches sigh,  
A voice would hum, so soft and sly.  
Not loud enough to speak aloud,  
But clear enough to shift a cloud.  

Each tile held memoryâ€™s quiet seamâ€”  
The nickname from a classroom dream.  
A lullaby of echoes past,  
A hope that hearts could still hold fast.  

For though the names may fade from lips,  
They lingered here in whispered slips.  
And every step along that way  
Could call a name back into play.

### ðŸ“˜ Stanza Summary

These shingles were more than shinglesâ€”they were mnemonic sentinels. Coded to absorb the vibrations and acoustic traces of children at play, they retained fragments of identity: the way a friend once laughed your name, the chant of a team, the song you invented together on a rainy day. Over time, they murmured these names softly back into the air, forming an ambient chorus of belonging, helping lost kids feel found againâ€”even when they didnâ€™t know they were searching.
