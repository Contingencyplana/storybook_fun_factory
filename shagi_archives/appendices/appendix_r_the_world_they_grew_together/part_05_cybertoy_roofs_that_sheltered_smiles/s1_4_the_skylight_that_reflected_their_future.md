# 📘 s1_4 – The Skylight That Reflected Their Future  
*Where the roof became a window into tomorrow*

Above the playroom, bright and high,  
A circle carved into the sky.  
Not just for light—it held a view  
Of what the child and toy might do.  

At dusk it shimmered dreams in glass,  
Not fixed in time, but yet to pass.  
A future shaped by smiles and code,  
By hands held tight along the road.  

The skylight did not tell, but show—  
A garden they had yet to grow,  
A leap they'd take, a word they'd teach,  
A place they’d reach but never reach.  

Reflection danced with hope and lore,  
Projecting more than roofs restore.  
It watched the ones who dreamed and grew—  
And softly showed what might be true.

### 📘 Stanza Summary

The skylight was a recursive viewport, refracting present joy into speculative projection. It used a shimmer-field lens encoded with child–cybertoy bond signatures to render possible futures—soft probabilities—on the ceiling below. Not prophecy, not prediction, but possibility made visible. These weren’t goals or commands. They were gentle invitations: “If you keep loving this way, here’s what you might become.”
