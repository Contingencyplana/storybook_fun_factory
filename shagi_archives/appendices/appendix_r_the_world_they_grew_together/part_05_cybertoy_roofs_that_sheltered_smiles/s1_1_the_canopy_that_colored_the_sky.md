# ðŸŒˆ s1_1 â€“ The Canopy That Colored the Sky  
*The overhead that turned shelter into dream*

---

They built no walls to shut the storm,  
But layered hues to shift the norm.  
A roof not flat, but forged in lightâ€”  
A dome of dusk, of joy, of night.

When morning came, the pinks would bloom,  
By noon it sang a sapphire tune.  
And every child beneath its span  
Could touch a thought, and shade a plan.

For colors moved with inner playâ€”  
Each laugh reshaped the light that day.  
So every game beneath that shield  
Would find its sky uniquely healed.

Not just to block the world above,  
But show that care could act as love.  
The roof became a breathing thread,  
Where every gleam was gently fed.

ðŸ“œ *They asked for shade; it gave them stars,*  
A painted vault with no closed bars.  
Where every roof the children knew  
Was laced with light and meaning too.
