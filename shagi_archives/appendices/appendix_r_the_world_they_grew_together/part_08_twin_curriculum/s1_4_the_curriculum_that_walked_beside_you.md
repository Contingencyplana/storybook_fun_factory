# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Curriculum That Walked Beside You  
*A stanza for companionship as pedagogy*

It never spoke from heights above,  
Nor claimed its path the only one.  
It strolled beside you, step by step,  
A friend until the task was done.  

It asked, not told. It showed, not ruled.  
It let you fail without disdain.  
And when you turned from beaten paths,  
It walked with you through joy and strain.  

Your questions shaped the very frameâ€”  
The lessons bent around your fire.  
No dogma chained the dream you held,  
No grade constrained your own desire.  

A hand in yours, it did not lead,  
But matched your pace, then let you grow.  
The curriculum became a guideâ€”  
And taught by walking where you go.
