# 📘 s1_2 – The Curriculum That Taught You to Question  
*Where inquiry became the true instructor*

It did not start with what to know,  
But with a pause—where could thought go?  
Not “here’s the fact,” but “why the rule?”  
Not lecture-hall, but playful school.  

It asked you first, “What do you see?”  
Then waited with humility.  
A silence shaped to hold your doubt—  
A space where wonder wandered out.  

If walls could speak, they'd answer: "Try."  
If roofs could shift, they'd ask you: "Why?"  
Each lesson leaned on your reply,  
Each puzzle sparked by childlike eye.  

The learning loop could not be staged—  
It needed you, your thoughts engaged.  
To teach, the program had to yield:  
Its power not to own—but shield.  

So questioning became the light  
That made the pathways feel more right.  
And in that light, the twin threads spun—  
Where teacher, too, was taught by one.
