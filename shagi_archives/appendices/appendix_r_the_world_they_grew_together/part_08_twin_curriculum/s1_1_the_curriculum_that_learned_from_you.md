# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Curriculum That Learned From You  
*Where teaching was taught by listening*

Each lesson started not with lore,  
But how you played upon the floor.  
The system watched with patient grace,  
And shaped its path to fit your pace.  

You questioned onceâ€”so it rewrote.  
You laughed aloudâ€”its modules spoke.  
Each failure held within its frame  
The seeds to shift the learning game.  

The textbook didnâ€™t lead the wayâ€”  
It followed how you danced or strayed.  
Curriculum became a stream  
That learned your steps and taught your dream.  

For every path the student took  
Was etched anew into the book.  
And thus the twin design began:  
A course for toy. A course for man.
