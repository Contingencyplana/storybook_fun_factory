# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Curriculum That Became a Game  
*Where knowing laughed its way to light*

They didnâ€™t teach with chalk or chart,  
But with a puzzle dressed as art.  
Each rule was wrapped in joyful playâ€”  
You learned because it played your way.  

The math was danced upon the floor,  
The grammar hid in mimic lore.  
You learned to code by chasing bugs,  
To navigate through joyful shrugs.  

No score was keptâ€”yet you excelled.  
No test was givenâ€”yet you spelled.  
Each answer earned a spark, not grade;  
Each level passed through joy conveyed.  

A world where right was found through try,  
Where wrongs were how you learned to fly.  
Curriculum dissolved its nameâ€”  
And school, at last, became a game.
