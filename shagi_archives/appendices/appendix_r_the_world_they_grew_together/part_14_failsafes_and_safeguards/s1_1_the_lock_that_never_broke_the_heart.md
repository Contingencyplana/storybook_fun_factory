# 🔐 s1_1 – The Lock That Never Broke the Heart  
*A stanza for the safeguard that held without harm*

It clicked in place, a quiet sound,  
A promise made in form and bound.  
No chain, no gate, no iron ring—  
Just care encoded in the spring.  

It held the door but left it free,  
A latch of trust, not mastery.  
It knew the child might come or go,  
And still would guard the path below.  

Its purpose was not fear or fence,  
But love shaped into common sense.  
To brace the frame, to catch the fall—  
A lock that never judged at all.  

So when the child returned one day,  
The door had never turned away.  
The lock still clicked, the frame still hummed—  
A home still open, never numbed.  

And in that simple, silent part  
Lived love that never broke the heart.  
The safety came not from control—  
But from a lock that made things whole.
