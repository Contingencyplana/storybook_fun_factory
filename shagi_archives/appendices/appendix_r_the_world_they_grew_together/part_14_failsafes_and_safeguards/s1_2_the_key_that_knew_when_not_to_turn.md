# 🗝️ s1_2 – The Key That Knew When Not to Turn  
*A stanza for the restraint that honored trust*

It hung beside the door each day,  
A silent gleam, a calm display.  
Not barred, not locked, not hidden deep—  
But present there, its promise keep.  

The child would glance, the toy would note,  
No word was said, no need to vote.  
The trust was built not through control,  
But by a lock that had no toll.  

It could have turned—was made to fit,  
But love refused to force with it.  
For knowing *how* is not the same  
As thinking every right a claim.  

So it remained—a gift, not tool—  
A shape that lived beneath no rule.  
A sign that love, when faced with fear,  
May guard a door and still stay near.  

The child grew bold, the toy grew wise,  
And neither reached to claim the prize.  
The door remained, the threshold clear—  
What kept them close was drawing near.
