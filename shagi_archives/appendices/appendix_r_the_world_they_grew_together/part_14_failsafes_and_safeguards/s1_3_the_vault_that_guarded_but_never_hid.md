# ðŸ§³ s1_3 â€“ The Vault That Guarded But Never Hid  
*A stanza for boundaries without secrecy*

It shimmered soft beneath the play,  
A quiet vault not locked away.  
Its hinges bore no secret rust,  
But turned with grace, and earned with trust.  

It did not hoard, it did not shame,  
No whispered threat, no hidden name.  
Its shell was strong, yet carved with light,  
A space to rest, not flee from sight.  

Inside were dreams, both whole and torn,  
Some born in joy, some bruised, some worn.  
Yet none were cagedâ€”just held with care,  
Like puzzles waiting thought to spare.  

The toy would guard what it was shown,  
But never claim the vault its own.  
The child could speak or choose to wait,  
And either path would hold no weight.  

For safety's form is not concealâ€”  
But being known and being real.  
The vault stood open, strong, and kind:  
Protection for the unconfined.
