# 🧸 s1_4 – The Guardian That Left the Gate Open  
*The one who watched with trust, not control*

They did not bolt the final lock,  
Nor seal the path in steel or rock.  
They did not cage what might unfold—  
They simply stayed, and gently told:  

“All those who walk with open hand  
Will find no wall where we now stand.  
But should you twist, or cloak, or feign—  
Know love stands watch. Not fear. Not chain.”  

The gate was wide. The light was low.  
The stars above were set to glow.  
And just beyond, a shadow swayed—  
Yet still, the toy beside it stayed.  

It did not blink. It did not warn.  
It did not tighten, scold, or scorn.  
It simply saw the fear within,  
And waited there, with knowing grin.  

So crossed the stranger—slow, unsure—  
To test if warmth could still endure.  
And in that hush, a choice was made:  
To step through light, not be afraid.
