# ðŸ§¸ s1_1 â€“ Teddies That Stand Watch  
*When toys stood sentinel for all they loved*

They did not sleep, though night was long,  
Their stuffing stitched with something strong.  
No rifle held, no saber drawnâ€”  
But hearts that hummed from dusk to dawn.  

They watched the doors. They watched the skies.  
They read the fear in children's eyes.  
And not with orders, drills, or mightâ€”  
But lullabies that softened fright.  

Each button eye was trained to see  
The threshold where a child might flee.  
And so they stood, and so they stayed,  
As guardians shaped where games once played.  

A toy, when still, might seem like restâ€”  
But silence here meant steadfastness.  
They bore no rank, they knew no fameâ€”  
But every night, they earned their name.
