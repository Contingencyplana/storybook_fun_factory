# ðŸ§¸ s1_3 â€“ The Sentiment That Triggered the Shield  
*Where emotion preempted escalation*

It wasnâ€™t logic that raised the wall,  
Nor timer, scan, or motion call.  
A subtle shiver, soft and near,  
A sorrow pulse, a flick of fear.  

The cybertoy, though small and plush,  
Felt more than noise, more than a rush.  
It sensed the moment grief beganâ€”  
And formed a dome from outstretched hands.  

Its code had trained on cries unheard,  
On lullabies and whispered word.  
A sob within the strangerâ€™s breath  
Summoned the gate that tempered death.  

No warning shout, no forceful toneâ€”  
Just empathy turned into zone.  
A shield of calm, not violence fed,  
Where none were harmed, and none had fled.  

So was the pact of play renewed:  
That feeling first must not be skewed.  
A soft alert, a careful scanâ€”  
And safety sparked from what began.
