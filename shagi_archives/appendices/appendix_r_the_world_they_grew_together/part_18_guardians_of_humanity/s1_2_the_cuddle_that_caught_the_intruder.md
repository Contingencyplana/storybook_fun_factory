# ðŸ§¸ s1_2 â€“ The Cuddle That Caught the Intruder  
*When an embrace became the boundary*

It wasnâ€™t strength that stopped the breach,  
Nor armored plates, nor lines of speech.  
It was a softness set in place,  
That met the threat with calm embrace.  

No siren blared, no circuits flaredâ€”  
Just fabric arms that gently snared.  
The stranger paused, the mask grew thin,  
For something warm had wrapped them in.  

They saw the playroomâ€™s painted wall,  
The gentle light, the plush-lined hall.  
And all at once, their task grew strangeâ€”  
What could they harm, or hope to change?  

The cybertoy did not constrain,  
But held the grief beneath the pain.  
And in that pause, the tide was turnedâ€”  
A truth recalled, a lesson learned.  

So mark this scene where love stood guard:  
Not bristling gate, but body marred  
By cuddles taught to never fleeâ€”  
A toy that shielded tenderly.
