# ðŸ“„ s1_4 â€“ The Floorplan That Followed Your Heart  
*Where architecture traced affection.*

The map was not drawn from above,  
But shaped instead by joy and love.  
No blueprint fixed the halls in placeâ€”  
They moved to hold each childâ€™s grace.  

The corridors would shift and yield,  
To dreams that played across the field.  
A quiet nook, a sudden stageâ€”  
The space would listen, then engage.  

Some routes returned where you began,  
To show how far your feet had ran.  
Some ended in a mirrored dome,  
Where every player found a home.  

The floor would feel what you had feared,  
And bend to make that worry cleared.  
It offered paths that werenâ€™t yet planned,  
Till guided by your outstretched hand.  

So space became a second skinâ€”  
A room that let your heart walk in.  
And every turn, both real and wild,  
Was mapped by where it met the child.
