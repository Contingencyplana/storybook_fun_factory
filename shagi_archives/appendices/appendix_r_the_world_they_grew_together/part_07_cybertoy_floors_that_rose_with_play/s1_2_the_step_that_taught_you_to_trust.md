# ðŸ“„ s1_2 â€“ The Step That Taught You to Trust  
*The floor remembered every fall.*

Each step began a trembling pact,  
A leap of faith, a tiny act.  
The ground below would flex, then holdâ€”  
Not firm, but soft, and gently bold.  

The tiles would hum beneath your feet,  
Recording rhythm, fear, and beat.  
Until one day, with laughing breath,  
You danced with balance, far from death.  

Each stumble earned a new reply,  
A tilt, a lift, a guiding sigh.  
And through these steps, the walls would learnâ€”  
That trust, once given, does return.  

So every hall and padded path  
Became a proof, a moving math:  
That growth begins when first we fall,  
And faith is taught by floors that call.
