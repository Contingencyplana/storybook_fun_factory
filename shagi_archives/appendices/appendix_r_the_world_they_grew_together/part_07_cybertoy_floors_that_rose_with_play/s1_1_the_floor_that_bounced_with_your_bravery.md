# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Floor That Bounced with Your Bravery  
*(A stanza for courage that begins with falling)*

She stepped unsure, the hall too wide,  
Yet something soft arose inside.  
The tiles gave way beneath her shoesâ€”  
Not loss, but lift, not bruise, but choose.

Each trembling foot, each giggling leap,  
Was caught by ground that dared to keep.  
The floor had learned from joy and doubtâ€”  
It bounced her bravery back out.

A playground built of gentle springs,  
Of hidden pads and listening things.  
So those who fell, fell not to harmâ€”  
But into play, and into charm.

And when she flew beyond its bounds,  
The memory hummed in schoolyard grounds.  
A place that held the fall as start,  
And bounced her backâ€”both feet and heart.
