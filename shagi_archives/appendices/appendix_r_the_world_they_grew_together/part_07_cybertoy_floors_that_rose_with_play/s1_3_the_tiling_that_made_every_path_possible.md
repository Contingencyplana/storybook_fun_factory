# ðŸ“„ s1_3 â€“ The Tiling That Made Every Path Possible  
*Where each tile waited for your next idea.*

The tiles were not laid row by rowâ€”  
They followed dreams of where to go.  
Not mapped in haste, nor pressed by plan,  
But listening deep to child and clan.  

One step would conjure ten more ways,  
Each shaped by play, by jokes, by praise.  
And soon a maze of paths unfurled,  
A playground map that shaped the world.  

No corridor was hard-assignedâ€”  
Just curious feet, and open mind.  
The floor became a canvas bright,  
Where children drew their paths in light.  

And in the grid, a wisdom grewâ€”  
A knowing where the next step flew.  
The tiling learned to shift and bend,  
And every path could re-extend.
