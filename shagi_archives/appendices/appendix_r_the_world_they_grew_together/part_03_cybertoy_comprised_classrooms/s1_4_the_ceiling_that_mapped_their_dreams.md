# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Ceiling That Mapped Their Dreams  
*(A stanza for the roof that watched them wonder, and learned to guide their gaze)*

Above their heads, the panels turned,  
With stars that shimmered, spun, and learned.  
Each childâ€™s thought a light unseenâ€”  
Now etched in constellationâ€™s gleam.  

When questions flew too wide for words,  
The ceiling stitched them into worlds.  
It drew their hopes in stellar threadâ€”  
A tapestry their longing fed.  

By night it taught in quiet glow,  
The ancient myths they'd yet to know.  
By day it mirrored dreams anewâ€”  
And hinted paths they might pursue.  

And when they left to chase those skies,  
It folded maps from lullabies.  
A dome of dreams, of thought, of loreâ€”  
That knew what ceilings should be for.
