# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Window That Answered in Color  
*(A stanza for the glass that learned to reply in light and hue)*

You asked no question, spoke no word,  
Yet still the glass had somehow heard.  
It shimmered green when hope took root,  
And blushed with gold when wonder grew.  

In moments lost, it turned to blueâ€”  
A velvet hush that wrapped round you.  
It never told you what to feel,  
But mirrored truth the light revealed.  

When storm arose within your chest,  
It drew in clouds to help you rest.  
And when your mind ignited flame,  
It fractured light to write your name.  

So lessons came not just from books,  
But from the way the window looked.  
A spectral guide that saw your coreâ€”  
And opened more than just a door.
