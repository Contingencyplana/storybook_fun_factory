# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Room That Remembered Your Name  
*(A stanza for the space that saw, recalled, and responded)*

It knew the way you liked to sit,  
The corner where your quiet fit.  
It knew the way you tapped your penâ€”  
And when to ask, and ask again.  

The walls were soft with silent grace,  
They shifted shape to match your pace.  
They learned your laughter, paused your painâ€”  
The room that knew your joy and strain.  

No chalk was scraped, no voice grew soreâ€”  
For every class rebuilt the floor.  
And when you failed, it did not scoldâ€”  
But offered warmth where you were cold.  

So school began not with a bell,  
But when the room had learned you well.  
A space that saw, and spoke your frameâ€”  
The room that whispered back your name.
