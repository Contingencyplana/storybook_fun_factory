# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Desk That Grew with Every Question  
*(A stanza for the place that changed as you asked, and asked again)*

The desk was bare the first day in,  
A simple shape, a quiet skin.  
But then you asked, and then it stirredâ€”  
And bloomed anew at every word.  

A drawer appeared for thoughts to hide,  
A light arose when you inquired.  
Its surface branched with puzzle leavesâ€”  
A forest drawn from question-seeds.  

It whispered paths you had not seen,  
Unfolded tools to chase a dream.  
It never judged, but gave you spaceâ€”  
To build a world, to leave a trace.  

And when you stopped to rest or sigh,  
It curled around like lullaby.  
The desk became more tree than toolâ€”  
A growing thing inside the school.
