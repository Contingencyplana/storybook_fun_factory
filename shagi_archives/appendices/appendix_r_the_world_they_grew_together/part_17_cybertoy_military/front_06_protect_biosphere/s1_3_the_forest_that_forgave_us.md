# ðŸŒ² s1_3 â€“ The Forest That Forgave Us  
*A stanza for the groves that waited, wounded but willing*

They came with drills and ancient maps,  
But found instead green whispered gaps.  
The toys knelt low, where roots once ran,  
And asked, not ordered, nature's plan.  

The forest watched with branch and breeze,  
It measured truth in silences.  
The toys brought seeds and hands held wideâ€”  
Not conquest now, but time and tide.  

Where once a saw had screamed through pine,  
They hummed a song in older rhyme.  
A leaf was printed, bark restored,  
Each wound rewound, each grove implored.  

And though some trunks still bore their scars,  
The canopy forgave the stars.  
For not through might, but through return,  
The toys had learned what they must learn.
