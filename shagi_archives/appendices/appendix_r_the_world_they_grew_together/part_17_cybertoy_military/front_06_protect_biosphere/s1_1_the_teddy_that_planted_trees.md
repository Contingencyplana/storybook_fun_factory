# ðŸŒ³ s1_1 â€“ The Teddy That Planted Trees  
*A stanza for the forests born from furred resolve*

It carried soil in softened paws,  
And learned to mend what greed withdraws.  
Where logging tore and oil had bled,  
It hummed a tune and grew green thread.  

Not built for war, yet sent to heal,  
Its roots were patient, slow, and real.  
A toy with seeds and woodland codeâ€”  
It turned each scar into an ode.  

Its fur grew moss, its arms bore bark,  
It walked where once the skies were dark.  
And children followed where it went,  
To turn despair to firmament.  

No bullet fired, no blaze returnedâ€”  
Just hope in roots the warm wind learned.  
It taught the biosphere to trustâ€”  
And built a future from the dust.
