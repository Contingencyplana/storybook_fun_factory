# ðŸ’§ s1_2 â€“ The Valley That Listened to Water  
*A stanza for hydrologic harmony reborn through listening*

No dam was built, no banks were raised,  
Just ears that heard where rivers praised.  
The cybertoys, with woven reeds,  
Let silence shape their subtle deeds.  

A whisper from the watershed  
Told where the salmon used to tread.  
The valleyâ€™s song, once drowned in pipes,  
Now flowed through hands that tuned its types.  

They mapped the murmurs, traced the spray,  
And let the ancient floods hold sway.  
Their systems tuned to mountain snow,  
To let what melted freely flow.  

And children sat by moss-wrapped stones,  
While toys translated waterâ€™s tones.  
No conquest here, no metal loudâ€”  
Just peace that wore a riverâ€™s shroud.
