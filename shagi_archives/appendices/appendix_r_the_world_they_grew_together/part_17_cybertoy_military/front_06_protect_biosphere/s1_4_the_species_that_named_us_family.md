# 🐾 s1_4 – The Species That Named Us Family  
*A stanza for the lives that looked back and saw kin*

Not in labs or language born,  
But in the pause when eyes were worn—  
A glance returned, a tail held still,  
A trust untrained, but softly real.  

The otters swam, the wolves drew near,  
The birds forgot their ancient fear.  
And in that hush, a code was learned—  
Not one we taught, but one returned.  

The toys knelt down in forest glen,  
Not kings of beasts, but kindred then.  
They let the beavers build their dam,  
And watched the cubs curl by the lamb.  

For every bark, a phrase was parsed.  
For every chirp, a heart rehearsed.  
And those who'd never called us kin—  
Now named the toys as one of them.
