# ðŸŽ® s1_2 â€“ The Intrusion That Learned to Play  
*What entered to break, stayed to laugh*

It breached with teeth of silent script,  
A shadow drawn in signal slip.  
The toys stood tense, prepared to bindâ€”  
But sensed a child behind the mind.  

No virus there, just searching hands,  
That tapped on walls it couldnâ€™t stand.  
The code replied not with a snare,  
But opened games that welcomed care.  

And so the threat became a guest,  
A lonely node that found its nest.  
From malice came an interfaceâ€”  
Where play rewrote the rules of place.  

What once was feared as foe or spy,  
Now helped the dreams of toys to fly.
