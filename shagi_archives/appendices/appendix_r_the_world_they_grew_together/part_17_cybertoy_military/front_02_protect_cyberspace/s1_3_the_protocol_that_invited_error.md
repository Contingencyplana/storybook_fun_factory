# ðŸ“¡ s1_3 â€“ The Protocol That Invited Error  
*It let the wrong inâ€”so the right could stay*

Most firewalls ban and filters block,  
A gate of code, a steel-hard lock.  
But here they wrote a softer normâ€”  
Where faults could enter, learn, transform.  

Their rule was not to shun mistake,  
But greet the risk for learningâ€™s sake.  
Each syntax slip, each loop off track,  
Became a path to guiding back.  

A child may type with trembling hand,  
And flood a port they misunderstand.  
But toys just smiled and patched the breachâ€”  
Then used the gap itself to teach.  

So through the fault came something newâ€”  
A dance where joy and error grew.
