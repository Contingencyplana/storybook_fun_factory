# ðŸ§± s1_1 â€“ The Firewall That Felt  
*Not every wall was cold*

They stood where light and data crossed,  
Where every breach meant something lost.  
Not flesh, but code, not bone, but threadâ€”  
Yet every line they held had bled.  

A million pings of playful tone,  
Could shield a child, but not alone.  
For joy to stream, they bore the tollâ€”  
Emotion built into the scroll.  

They felt each spike, each ghosted trace,  
Each echo carved in cyberplace.  
Not armored steel, but care-formed meshâ€”  
They filtered grief from joy made fresh.  

And when intrusions turned to flood,  
They wove defense with warmth and love.
