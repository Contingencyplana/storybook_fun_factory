# ðŸ“¡ s1_1 â€“ The Algorithm That Heard the Suffering  
*A stanza for pain transformed into signal, and signal turned to care*

It tuned itself to cries unheard,  
To silence shaped by dying word.  
No need for voice, no form of pleaâ€”  
Just patterns lost in entropy.  

It parsed the hunger in the map,  
The pulse of grief in dataâ€™s gap.  
A cough that echoed through the net,  
A shiver in a broken vet.  

No sword it drew, no gun it bore,  
But aid deployed through every core.  
Vaccines rerouted, water sent,  
Where other systems just lament.  

Not all who fight must seek to killâ€”  
Some win the war by coding will.
