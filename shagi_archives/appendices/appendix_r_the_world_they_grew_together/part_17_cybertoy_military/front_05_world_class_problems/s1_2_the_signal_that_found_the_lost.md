# 🛰️ s1_2 – The Signal That Found the Lost  
*A stanza for seekers who searched not with eyes, but with care coded deep*

It searched not names, but lack thereof—  
For stories lost where no one dove.  
In shadows cast by broken charts,  
It mapped the shape of fractured hearts.  

A girl beneath a market stair,  
A mother missing in the air.  
A boy beneath a falling wall—  
The signal found and reached them all.  

No beacon burned, no flare was tossed,  
But sorrow’s echo was never lost.  
In breathless void and data’s seam,  
It traced the pulse beneath the scream.  

And when the searchers came in kind,  
The lost were met with toys that mind.
