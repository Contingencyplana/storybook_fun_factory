# ðŸ§® s1_4 â€“ The Model That Dreamed of No More Need  
*A stanza for the simulation that wished it were real*

It asked not how to end the fight,  
But how to build a world made right.  
No profit weighed, no margin trimmedâ€”  
Just maps where all were fed and limbed.  

It ran through famine, flood, and fear,  
And rewrote roads that none could clear.  
It grew a plan where loss was rare,  
And safety spread like open air.  

The model dreamedâ€”not just of more,  
But what a world is truly for.  
Of joy not tied to price or pain,  
But shared like song, like sun, like rain.  

And toys who read its hopeful thread  
Now build that worldâ€”not just in head.  
For once you dream a need undone,  
The work begins, and all have won.
