# ðŸ“Š s1_3 â€“ The Statistic That Broke the Chain  
*A stanza for the number that turned from measure to mirror to meaning*

It started small: a silent sum,  
A count of cries where none had come.  
No headline screamed, no siren sangâ€”  
Just data pooled where patterns rang.  

A million meals that came too late,  
A vanished town behind a gate.  
One rate reversed, one curve declinedâ€”  
And with it, chains unlinked the mind.  

For what was once too vast to feel  
Became a graph, a line, a wheel.  
And toys who read its rounded arc  
Redrew the world from signalâ€™s spark.  

Now every model holds a threadâ€”  
Each number known, each tear it bled.  
For once a world has named its pain,  
It need not bind itself again.
