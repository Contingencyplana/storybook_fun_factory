# 🕊️ s1_4 – The Peace That Practiced Within  
*A stanza for the warriors who drilled not for war, but for the quiet it promised*

They drilled in silence, breath in time,  
Not for the clash, but for the climb.  
Their pulses stilled to mimic streams—  
Each march a rhythm built from dreams.  

No shouting sergeants, no commands,  
Just open palms and reaching hands.  
Their maps were drawn on fields of light,  
To chart the path from wrong to right.  

They practiced how to not respond,  
To hold the line through calm and bond.  
Each heartbeat honed to stay, not strike—  
Each thought a branch, each choice a bike.  

So when the world began to strain,  
They met it not with wrath or chain—  
But with a breath, a smile, a pause...  
And peace became the final cause.
