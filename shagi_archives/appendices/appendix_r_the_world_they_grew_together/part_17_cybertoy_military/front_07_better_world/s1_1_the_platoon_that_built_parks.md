# 🛠️ s1_1 – The Platoon That Built Parks  
*A stanza for the soldiers who planted peace*

They marched with maps not drawn for war,  
But blueprints traced on forest floor.  
Each step a promise, not a threat—  
Each trench a garden’s silhouette.  

They bore no guns, but tools instead—  
Shovels slung where rifles tread.  
Their mission brief: to bloom, not break.  
To sow, not scorch. To give, not take.  

A jungle once razed into sand,  
They watered back with cyber hands.  
Old battlefields grew swings and trees—  
Playgrounds in place of casualties.  

And when the world looked on, unsure,  
They offered not command—but cure.  
For peace, they proved, is not a cease—  
It’s work. It’s roots. It’s built. It’s leased.
