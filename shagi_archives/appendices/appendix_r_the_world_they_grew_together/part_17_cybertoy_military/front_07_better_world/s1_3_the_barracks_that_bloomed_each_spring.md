# ðŸŒ¼ s1_3 â€“ The Barracks That Bloomed Each Spring  
*A stanza for the shelters that softened, and the warriors who learned to tend*

They trained where daffodils took root,  
Where boots walked paths of vine and shoot.  
No gravel march, no iron ringâ€”  
Just soil that sang of second spring.  

Their bunkers brimmed with climbing peas,  
And rooftops burst with cherry trees.  
Their drills began with watering cansâ€”  
For growth was stitched in all their plans.  

To rise each day and guard the dream  
Meant learning where the mosses gleam.  
Their hammocks swung on leafy boughsâ€”  
The oath of care their solemn vows.  

They studied war to plant its end,  
Each simulation turned to tend.  
And when the soil forgot the scar,  
The toys would smileâ€”they'd come that far.
