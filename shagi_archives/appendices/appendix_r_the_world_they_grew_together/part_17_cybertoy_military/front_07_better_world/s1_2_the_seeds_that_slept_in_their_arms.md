# ðŸŒ± s1_2 â€“ The Seeds That Slept in Their Arms  
*A stanza for the saplings that marched in silence and woke in sun*

They carried seeds like sacred charms,  
Held close in chestplates, safe from harms.  
In pouches soft or sockets wide,  
Each sprout a dream the war denied.  

Where others bore the mark of flame,  
They bore green futures, none the same.  
No payload dropped, no missile flungâ€”  
Just forests born from battles wrung.  

The lull between two conflict calls  
Would bloom with roots in cratered halls.  
A sapling whispered from its pod,  
Then stretched toward peace, toward sun, toward God.  

And when the mission turned to flame,  
Some seeds endured. Some still became.  
For every toy that gave its all,  
A tree stood sentinel, proud and tall.
