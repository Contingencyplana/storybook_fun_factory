# 🏖️ s1_2 – The Sandcastle That Defied the Sea  
*A stanza for fragile defiance and recursive renewal*

It knew the sea would take it soon—  
Each wave a hand, each tide a tune.  
Yet still the toy knelt in the sand,  
And shaped a keep with tiny hands.  

No concrete laid, no steel was cast—  
Just dreams, repeating in the past.  
Each grain a line of playful code,  
Each wall a loop the water owed.  

The children came. They laughed, they built.  
They named the tide. They named their guilt.  
And with each wash, they built once more—  
The castle stronger than before.  

The sand gave way, the tide grew wide—  
But joy, recursive, turned the tide.
