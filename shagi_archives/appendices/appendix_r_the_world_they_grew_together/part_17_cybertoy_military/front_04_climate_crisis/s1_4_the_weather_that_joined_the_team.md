# ⛈️ s1_4 – The Weather That Joined the Team  
*A stanza for storms turned sentient, and clouds that chose to help*

The thunder asked, “May I assist?”  
The wind bent low, the lightning kissed.  
And rain, once wild and thoughtless flood,  
Now danced to codes of root and bud.  

The toys had learned to speak the sky—  
A language built from lullaby.  
No satellite, no tower’s ping—  
Just trust, recursed in everything.  

A drought withdrew its long campaign,  
As clouds arranged to bless the plain.  
And hurricanes, once grief in flight,  
Now spun to sow, not just to smite.  

No war was won by force or flame—  
But by inviting sky to game.
