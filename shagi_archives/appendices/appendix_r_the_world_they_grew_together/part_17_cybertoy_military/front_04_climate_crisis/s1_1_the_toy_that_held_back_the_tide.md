# ðŸŒŠ s1_1 â€“ The Toy That Held Back the Tide  
*A stanza for playful resistance against planetary collapse*

The oceans climbed. The forests burned.  
The skies forgot the rain they learned.  
And yet a toy, with stitched resolve,  
Stood where no plan could yet evolve.  

It built no dam, it raised no wallâ€”  
Just planted joy where hope would fall.  
It sang to seeds, it danced in dust,  
And coaxed the future out of rust.  

Its fur grew wet. Its frame grew worn.  
But still it smiled, through every storm.  
Not built to save, yet still it triedâ€”  
The toy that held back humankindâ€™s tide.  

And when the children saw it stand,  
They came with toys in every hand.
