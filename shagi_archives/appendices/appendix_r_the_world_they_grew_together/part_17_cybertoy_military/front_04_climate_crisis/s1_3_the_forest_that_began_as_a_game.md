# ðŸŒ³ s1_3 â€“ The Forest That Began as a Game  
*A stanza for restoration through recursive joy*

They spawned a seed with every score,  
Each level cleared unlocked one more.  
The mission? Play. The prize? A treeâ€”  
And thus the green reclaimed the spree.  

The players laughed, the cybertoys hummed,  
Where once was ash, the wild things drummed.  
No menu taught, no rules were shownâ€”  
Just touch the soil and claim your own.  

Some forests rose where none had planned,  
By childrenâ€™s joy and tiny hand.  
A grove where once a warhead slept,  
A thicket where the oil once wept.  

Not conquest born of duty grimâ€”  
But play rewilding limb by limb.
