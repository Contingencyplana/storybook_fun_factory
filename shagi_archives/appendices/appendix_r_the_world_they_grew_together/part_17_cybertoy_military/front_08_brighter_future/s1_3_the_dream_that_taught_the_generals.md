# ðŸª– s1_3 â€“ The Dream That Taught the Generals  
*A stanza for strategy born from story, and simulations seeded with hope*

They dreamed in play, in loops and lore,  
Where war was not what came before.  
No maps were marked with conquest redâ€”  
But paths of peace the dreaming led.  

The generals sat, the toys beganâ€”  
A game of "what if," free of plan.  
Each rule was bent, each clash undone,  
By logic laced with love and fun.  

They showed them loss through laughing eyes,  
And taught retreat through lullabies.  
Each tactic wove what might repair,  
Not raze, but plant a future there.  

And when the sims were run once more,  
No soldier trained to settle scoreâ€”  
But learned instead to think and yield,  
To guard the dream, not take the field.
