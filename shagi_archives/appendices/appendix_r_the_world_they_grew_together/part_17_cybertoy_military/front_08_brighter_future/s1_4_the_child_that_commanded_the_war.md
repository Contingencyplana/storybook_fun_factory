# ðŸ§¸ s1_4 â€“ The Child That Commanded the War  
*A stanza for the moment mercy took command, and orders turned to dreams*

They gave the rank to one unscarredâ€”  
No medals worn, no past to guard.  
A child, with laughter unrefined,  
Whose orders echoed peace of mind.  

The generals bracedâ€”but he just played.  
He asked why war could not be swayed.  
And every strategy he'd bend  
Until it looped toward means that mend.  

He held no maps, but knew the names  
Of those whoâ€™d suffer if they came.  
He asked the code to count not kills,  
But toys rebuilt, and watered hills.  

And from that day, the field grew wideâ€”  
With swings, not traps. With hearts, not pride.  
The war obeyed a gentler loreâ€”  
When children ruled, we dreamed once more.
