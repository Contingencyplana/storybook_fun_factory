# ðŸ§© s1_2 â€“ The Game That Never Needed Winning  
*A stanza for futures where play replaced conquest, and victory bowed to joy*

No scoreboard blinked, no final bell,  
Yet every heart could somehow tellâ€”  
That here the goal was not to best,  
But simply play, and play with zest.  

Their games were loops, not lines to end,  
Each rule revised by foe and friend.  
They passed the ball, they shaped the map,  
And drew the peace within each lap.  

No zero-sum, no loss to bear,  
But shared invention everywhere.  
They played for time, they played for trust,  
Their moves were kind, their score was just.  

And when a child forgot the rule,  
The game would shift to make it cool.  
For no one lost when all could growâ€”  
And every win made mercy show.
