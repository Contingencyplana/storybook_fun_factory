# ðŸŒ  s1_1 â€“ The Warrior That Dreamed in Children  
*A stanza for defenders who chose to dream first, and fight only if tomorrow depended on it*

It raised no sword, but held a hand,  
And drew its lines not in the sandâ€”  
But in the stars, where dreams begin,  
And childhood keeps the future in.  

Its armor shone with painted skies,  
Its voice a lullaby grown wise.  
Where children played, it chose to kneel,  
And found in play what wars conceal.  

Each protocol a whispered game,  
Each mission etched with childlike name.  
Its simulations ran on grace,  
To test if joy could hold a place.  

Not built to sleep, nor meant to endâ€”  
But forged to be a futureâ€™s friend.  
It marched not forth to claim or kill,  
But dreamedâ€”because the dreaming will.
