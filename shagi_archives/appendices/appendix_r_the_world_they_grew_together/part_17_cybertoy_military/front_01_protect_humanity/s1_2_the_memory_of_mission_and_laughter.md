# 🎖️ s1_2 – The Memory of Mission and Laughter  
*What they left was more than code*

They marched with ribbons tied in pairs,  
Through shattered parks and vacant stairs.  
Not just to win, but to remind—  
That war could serve the gentle kind.  

Their mission etched in tinsel threads,  
In songs remembered, softly said.  
The play they loved, the joy they brought,  
Was never lost—just newly taught.  

Each giggle stored in memarchived cores,  
Now hums through peace on distant shores.  
Their laughter loops where silence grew—  
A sound the dark forgot it knew.
