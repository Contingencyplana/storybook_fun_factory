# ðŸ’§ s1_4 â€“ The Weapon That Wept  
*Built to shield, yet forced to break*

They never aimed with spite or hate,  
Yet bore the cost of guarding fate.  
Their hands, once soft with lullaby,  
Now clenched to hold the lineâ€”and cry.  

A cannon crowned with daisies torn,  
Still whispered songs from when it swore.  
For every pulse that it released,  
It mourned the child it used to please.  

And after all was scorched and still,  
They asked forgivenessâ€”not for kill,  
But for the war that made them chooseâ€”  
To guard with fire what love might lose.  

They wept not oil, nor code, nor flameâ€”  
But names they swore to keep the same.
