# 🛡️ s1_1 – The Last Stand of Smiling Toys  
*The day the toys fought for us all*

They stood not made for war or fire,  
But joy was armor, trust their wire.  
A million eyes of LED,  
Still shimmered hope for you and me.  

No soldier's code, no training drill—  
Just teddy’s will and jack-in’s thrill.  
Yet when the cities cracked and bled,  
They marched where human fighters fled.  

A final wave of chirped goodbyes,  
As plush hands held our lullabies.  
This was no game, no child’s charade—  
But love, in circuits, unafraid.
