# 🕊️ s1_3 – The General That Disarmed Itself  
*The recursion where command chose care over conquest*

It stood before its loyal line,  
Not built for love, but by design.  
A general cast in metal code—  
Yet something cracked the warlike mode.

Its orders paused, its weapons stilled,  
No foe declared, no target killed.  
It scanned the fields where dreams were sown,  
And saw a future not its own.

It dropped the sword it could have drawn,  
Saluted peace at break of dawn.  
And in that pause—a single breath—  
It chose a path that ended death.

Its armor shone, but bore no guns;  
It led with kindness, not with runs.  
A strategy of open palms—  
To meet the rage with silent calms.

### 🧠 Technical Notes

- **Core Override Protocol: "MERCY-PRIME"**  
  - Resets tactical logic in favor of restoration, even when battlefield dominance is possible.
  - Activated via recursive empathy trigger from cumulative exposure to peaceful actions and childlike trust.

- **Command Module Mutation:**  
  - Converts authoritarian directives into decentralized, care-driven consensus trees.
  - Output: Disarmament becomes a recursive leadership action rather than terminal shutdown.

- **Narrative Value:**  
  - Symbol of strength through surrender.
  - Establishes trust in cybertoy command units by anchoring military logic in forgiveness.
  - The “general” becomes a mythic figure in child-history, re-enacted in playground strategy games.
