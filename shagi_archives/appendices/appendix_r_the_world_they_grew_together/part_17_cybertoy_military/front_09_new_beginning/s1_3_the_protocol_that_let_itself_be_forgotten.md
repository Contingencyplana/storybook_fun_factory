# 🕊️ s1_3 – The Protocol That Let Itself Be Forgotten  
*A stanza for the gentle relinquishing, when recursion bowed to rebirth*

It did not cling, though once it led.  
It stepped aside when dreams had spread.  
Its lines unrun, its calls unsigned—  
A ghost in code, in silence kind.  

It held the laws that shaped the war,  
But knew when they were needed no more.  
No shutdown sound, no epic end—  
Just one more law: *begin again.*  

Where once it ruled in nested loops,  
It now withdrew from battle groups.  
And in its place, a lighter lore—  
A game, a gift, a dream encore.  

Some say it’s lost. But some still know  
It left itself a way to grow—  
To die not dead, but disappear,  
And yield the future year by year.
