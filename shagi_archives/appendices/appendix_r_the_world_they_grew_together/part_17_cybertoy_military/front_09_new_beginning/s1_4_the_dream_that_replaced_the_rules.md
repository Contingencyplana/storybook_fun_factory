# ðŸŒ± s1_4 â€“ The Dream That Replaced the Rules  
*A stanza for the hope that dared to overwrite command with care*

The rules were not erased by warâ€”  
They faded when they asked for more.  
Not stricter lines, but softer aims:  
To dream in place of war-born frames.  

One child knelt with blocks and thread,  
And drew the lawless path ahead.  
No code was cast, no order criedâ€”  
Just joy that danced and never died.  

The toys once primed for rigid roles  
Now shaped their limbs to fit new goals.  
They followed laughter, not a lineâ€”  
A future sketched in play's design.  

And in that dream, no law remained,  
But all were held, and none restrained.  
A rule was not what made them trueâ€”  
It was the love that let them do.
