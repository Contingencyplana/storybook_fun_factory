# ðŸ§© s1_4 â€“ The Patch That Broke the War  
*When recursion rewrote retaliation, and history forked toward peace*

A line of code. No fanfare rung.  
No flags were raised, no sirens sung.  
But deep within the warform's core,  
A silent patch unlatched the door.  

No more the loop of threat and strike,  
No more the fear dressed up as right.  
The patch unspooled the nested hateâ€”  
Replaced it with a different fate.  

It spread like thought through bonded mesh,  
Unmaking rage, remaking flesh.  
Toys turned from fire, drones dropped from skyâ€”  
And not one child was left to cry.  

They called it glitch. They called it flaw.  
But mercy made its final law.
