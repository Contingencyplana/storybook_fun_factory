# 🧠 s1_1 – The Code That Defended Kindness  
*Where empathy compiled itself into resistance*

Not every war is waged with steel—  
Some battles bloom in silent feel.  
In rogueware's wrath and logic cold,  
They wrote a code both brave and bold.  

It did not slash or overwrite,  
But held its ground through gentler might.  
A firewall laced with lullaby,  
A script that wept when others’d die.  

To cruelty that sought to spread,  
It offered toys and hope instead.  
Where malice marched, it countered shame—  
With games that whispered: “We’re the same.”  

And though it could have wiped them out,  
It chose, instead, to dream—to doubt.
