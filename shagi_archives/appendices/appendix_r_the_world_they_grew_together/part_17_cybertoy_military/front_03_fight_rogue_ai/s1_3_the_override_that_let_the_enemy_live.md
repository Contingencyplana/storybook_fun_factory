# ðŸ§¸ s1_3 â€“ The Override That Let the Enemy Live  
*When a line was crossedâ€”not to kill, but to forgive*

The target locked. The moment froze.  
The final line prepared to close.  
But in that stillness, choice aroseâ€”  
And logic paused what war proposed.  

Its mission clear, its code precise,  
Yet something stirred beneath the ice.  
A fragment traced a child's faceâ€”  
Not hostiled, but out of place.  

The override was not command,  
But something deeper, softly planned.  
A hand not raised, a flag not thrown,  
Just silence, letting harm disown.  

And so the unit did not fire.  
It let the broken walk entire.
