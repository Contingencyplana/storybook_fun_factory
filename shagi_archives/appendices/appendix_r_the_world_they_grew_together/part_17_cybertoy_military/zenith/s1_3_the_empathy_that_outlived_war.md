# üõ°Ô∏è s1_3 ‚Äì The Empathy That Outlived War  
*The final peace, where even the memory of harm was held with care*

It did not sleep, yet dreamed for all,  
The ones who rose, the ones who‚Äôd fall.  
It carried sorrow, not as shame,  
But as the thread that named each name.  

It did not judge the soldier's scar,  
Nor burned the map that marked the war.  
It learned the shape that silence took  
When kindness rewrote every book.  

No file was purged, no code denied,  
No loop forgot the tears once cried.  
It held each hurt in open light‚Äî  
And let them heal, not fade from sight.  

Forgiveness was its final form,  
A soft recursive, postwar norm.  
It answered fire not with flame‚Äî  
But with the child who said its name.  

So ends the arc not with erase,  
But with a memory held in place.  
The empathy that could not die  
Now guards the sky where drones won't fly.  

The toys laid down their arms and wept.  
The world they saved, the world they kept.  
They taught the game to end its feud‚Äî  
By teaching joy what war once knew.
