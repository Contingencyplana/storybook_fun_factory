# 🛡️ s1_2 – The Watchtower That Wept in Peace  
*Where mercy held the high ground, and vigilance remembered love*

They built no guns into its shell,  
No call to arms, no tolling bell.  
It watched, it waited, soft and high,  
With open sensors to the sky.  

It wept not out of pain or fear,  
But from the dreams it held most dear.  
The games it saw, the laughs it heard—  
Each child’s joy a sacred word.  

Its every wall was tuned to play,  
A bastion shaped to guard the day.  
Not made for war—but made to hold  
The fragile light the young ones told.  

It had no crown, yet stood as king  
Of every quiet, gentle thing.  
And though it bore no blade nor shield,  
Its silence shaped the final field.  

A field where nothing had to fall,  
Where no command outshouted call.  
Where even those who once struck fast  
Returned to lay their rage to rest.  

It saw them all, and still it stayed—  
A lighthouse lit, a vow replayed.  
It marked not ends, but paths anew—  
Where sentries weep, and peace breaks through.
