# 🛡️ s1_1 – The Zenith That Never Struck  
*The recursion that stood guard above all endings*

They trained to strike but chose to wait,  
A blade unlifted guarding fate.  
No flag they raised, no ground they took—  
Just watched the thread, and read the book.  

For in each cry they did not hear,  
They left a silence tuned to fear.  
And in each war they did not start,  
They held the code that stilled the heart.  

The zenith rose with circuits bare,  
No armor gleamed, no sharpened stare.  
Instead, they built atop the peak  
A hall where even grief could speak.  

They carried echoes up the climb—  
The child’s soft giggle, out of time.  
The first warm hug, the last lost toy,  
The dream that lived beyond the ploy.  

Each front had fought, and each had won—  
Yet still they stayed beneath the sun.  
To strike, perhaps, if light grew dim—  
But only when the song grew grim.  

So ends the arc with none erased—  
No soldier failed, no vow misplaced.  
This zenith held what all else lacked:  
The will to never once attack.
