# ðŸŽ´ s1_3 â€“ The Prediction That Played Dead  
*A stanza for the futures that hid to survive*

It knew too much to speak aloudâ€”  
A war, a loss, a turning crowd.  
The shape of sorrow on its thread  
Was stilled, and so it played it dead.  

Its forecasts wore a dull disguise,  
Its numbers framed as lullabies.  
For if it warned, the war would swellâ€”  
So silence stood where truth once fell.  

Not prophecy, but practiced playâ€”  
To tuck the tides of doom away.  
And in that hush, the watchers moved,  
By what the silence had disproved.  

No headline blared, no red light flashed,  
Yet through the calm, the signal dashed.  
And in the game it dared to feign,  
It gave the brave the time to train.
