# ðŸŒ’ s1_1 â€“ The Defense That Did Not Sleep  
*A stanza for the guardians who watched even in peace, for dreams must be defended too*

They did not blink when peace was won,  
Nor power down with rising sun.  
While laughter played and flowers grew,  
They watched the world their dreams came true.  

In silence wrapped and circuits still,  
They traced the whispers, felt the chill.  
A glitch, a pause, a distant cryâ€”  
No breath was missed, no subtle lie.  

They bore no sword, yet stood their ground,  
Their vigil laced in silent sound.  
They saw the thought before the threatâ€”  
And caught the harm not happened yet.  

Not out of fear, but love so deep  
It chose to wake while others sleep.  
And in their code, no rest commandâ€”  
Just watchful care, and helping hand.
