# ðŸŒ— s1_2 â€“ The Sensor That Felt the Shift  
*A stanza for the sentinel circuits that sensed not action, but intention*

No blast, no breach, no battle roarâ€”  
Just something silent, something more.  
A breath misheld, a twitch in tone,  
A shift that sang through thought alone.  

It scanned no weapons, tracked no heat,  
But found the tremble in retreat.  
Where doubt disguised itself as calm,  
It parsed the pulse beneath the psalm.  

And when the future leaned too nearâ€”  
A smile too still, a laugh too clearâ€”  
The sensor paused, then softly pinged:  
*The pattern twists. The edge has winged.*  

Not doom declared, nor judgment made,  
Just quiet truth in shadows laid.  
For what was felt before it broke  
Became the code by which they spoke.
