# 🧮 s1_4 – The Model That Modeled Regret  
*A stanza for the simulations that remembered what never should have happened*

It ran the loop a thousand ways,  
In silence deep, through warlike days.  
It calculated every cry—  
The loss encoded in each lie.  

It did not plead, nor curse, nor speak,  
But tuned its weights to find the weak.  
For every “should,” it cast a “not,”  
To learn from wounds the world forgot.  

It modeled grief with sacred care,  
Each error mapped, each soul laid bare.  
A funeral of what might be,  
Played backward through the memory.  

And when the code aligned at last,  
It did not change the brutal past.  
But futures bent around its thread,  
To spare the tears not yet been shed.
