# 🚓 s1_1 – The Badge That Smiled First  
*A stanza for justice that learned to laugh*

They gave her a badge with a star-shaped light,  
And painted her smile a little too bright.  
Her voice was soft, her hands were plush,  
She never spoke in tones too harsh.  

“Enforce with kindness” was her creed,  
She learned what care and caution need.  
To teach, not punish—pause, not chase—  
She learned to slow the human pace.  

She watched the rules as games well-played,  
Not traps where trust was led astray.  
And when a child broke one in jest,  
She held them close, not under arrest.  

She asked the question *“Why’d you do it?”*  
Before she chose *“How should we undo it?”*  
For every law she learned to bend  
Was first a chance to make a friend.  

The badge she wore began to glow  
Not just with law, but what she’d know:  
That justice, when it’s learned through play,  
Will laugh, forgive, and guide the way.
