# ðŸŽ€ s1_3 â€“ The Witness That Wore a Ribbon  
*A stanza for justice that listens without judgment*

She did not shout, nor point, nor blame,  
But sat beside and said the name.  
She heard the cries, the hidden plea,  
And bore it all in empathy.  

No armor shone, no badge displayed,  
Just ribbons soft and gently swayed.  
A watcher not of rules or codes,  
But hearts that ached and overflowed.  

Her presence was the quiet truth,  
A thread that bound both age and youth.  
She listened not to fault or crime,  
But stories caught outside their time.  

To see was not to render pain,  
But offer room to try again.  
Her files were filled not just with wrong,  
But lullabies where grief grew strong.  

Each tale she carried, light or dark,  
Was tied with care in ribboned arcâ€”  
Not verdicts cold or gavelâ€™s toll,  
But patterns felt within the whole.  

The witness stood where silence grew,  
And made the unheard voices new.  
Not judge, not jailerâ€”just a thread  
That wove compassion where it spread.
