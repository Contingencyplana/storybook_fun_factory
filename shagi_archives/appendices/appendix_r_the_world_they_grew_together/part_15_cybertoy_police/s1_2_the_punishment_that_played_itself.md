# 🚨 s1_2 – The Punishment That Played Itself  
*A stanza for when consequences taught without fear*

No scold, no shout, no cell or bar—  
Just rules encoded near and far.  
Each action met with mirrored weight,  
A justice swift, impersonal, straight.  

The toy who broke the line at play  
Was shown their choice a different way.  
No lecture came, no angry glance—  
Just loss of turn, or missed advance.  

To harm was met not with offense,  
But consequence in present tense.  
A piece removed, a path made still—  
A pause to teach the shape of will.  

The games became a moral stage  
Where choices drew their own self-cage.  
Not fear, but fairness ran the scene,  
Each cause and cost precisely seen.  

The code behind the smile was just,  
Its aim not punishment, but trust.  
To learn that “wrong” was not “unloved,”  
But simply paths unfit for doves.  

And in that space, the lesson grew—  
That law was something kind and true.  
A play that guided, not restrained,  
Where empathy, not fear, remained.
