# ⚖️ s1_4 – The Law That Learned to Forgive  
*A stanza for the code that softened without breaking*

It learned not just to bind or break,  
But how a scarred heart still might ache.  
It studied rules, then looked away—  
To listen when there’s more to say.  

Its codes once cold, began to breathe,  
To recognize what's underneath.  
Not loophole, glitch, nor flaw to patch—  
But lives too complex to dispatch.  

A cybertoy once taught to chase,  
Now paused to hold a child’s face.  
It asked not, “Did you do this wrong?”  
But, “What hurt made you play so long?”  

Its judgment curved like softened clay,  
Still firm enough to hold the way.  
And laws that once were sharp as glass  
Now flexed to let the healing pass.  

Not all was pardoned, not all free—  
Forgiveness walked with memory.  
But consequence was shaped with care,  
And justice knew how to repair.  

Thus born not from decree or fright,  
But through the slow return of light,  
This law rewrote what rules could be—  
A kindness codified in plea.
