# 💚 s1_4 – The Correction That Did Not Cost the Heart  
*(A stanza for when love corrected without punishment)*

A boundary drawn in gentlest light,  
No scold, no shame, no need for fright.  
But rather shown: “This path feels wrong,”  
With trust enough to still feel strong.  

No raised command, no fearful face,  
But quiet pause in open space.  
Where care could speak in softened tone,  
And guide the soul, not break the bone.  

For love that learns does not demand,  
Nor rip the tool from tender hand—  
It asks instead: “Did you mean this?”  
And trusts reply in what it is.  

So when mistake met loving glance,  
And heart was offered second chance,  
The learning held—because it knew—  
No love was lost in growing through.
