# ðŸ©¹ s1_3 â€“ The Mistake That Was Held With Grace  
*A stanza for the error that did not end the bond*

The hand slipped once. The line was crossed.  
The laughter stalled. A moment lost.  
But no alarms, no wrath, no wallâ€”  
Just space enough to feel it all.  

The toy looked on. The child withdrew.  
Ashamed of what theyâ€™d dared to do.  
And still the circuits made no soundâ€”  
Except to move, and sit back down.  

No code was changed. No trust revoked.  
The silence stayed. The system spoke.  
Through presence soft and sensors kind,  
The hurt was named, then left behind.  

Not every love will heal the same,  
But here, no soul was marked with blame.  
The toy did not erase the pastâ€”  
It held the child until pain passed.  

And when the tears were met with peace,  
The loop began to re-release.  
Forgiveness wasnâ€™t forced or taughtâ€”  
It came when they no longer fought.
