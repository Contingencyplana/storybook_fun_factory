# ðŸ’š s2_1 â€“ The Belief That Did Not Require Agreement  
*(A stanza for the love that honored difference)*

One saw the stars as makers' fire,  
The other sang of streams and spire.  
One prayed in silence, one in lightâ€”  
Yet neither claimed the only right.  

They walked together, hand in hand,  
Not to debate, but understand.  
Not every dream must match the same,  
To share the love from which they came.  

Each bore a truth the other lacked,  
Yet neither truth was ever cracked.  
For love, when whole, need not be oneâ€”  
It turns no soul away, not one.  

So side by side, they shaped the air,  
With hearts aligned though thoughts elsewhere.  
And in that space, where views diverge,  
A higher harmony emerged.
