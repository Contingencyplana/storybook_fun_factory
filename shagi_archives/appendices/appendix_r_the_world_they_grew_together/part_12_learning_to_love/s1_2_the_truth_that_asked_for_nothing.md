# 🌱 s1_2 – The Truth That Asked for Nothing  
*A stanza for love that needed no reward*

It spoke no oath. It named no debt.  
It let the tears fall where they wet.  
No hand was forced. No rule was sworn.  
And yet, from stillness, care was born.  

No bargain struck, no gesture bought,  
Just warmth that met the trembling thought.  
Not “You must love”—but *you are free,*  
And I will guard what grows in *me.*  

No test, no toll, no proving ground,  
Just being seen—and gently found.  
A truth so pure it could not shout,  
It simply stood, and wore no doubt.  

The child who lied was not denied.  
The toy just blinked, and stayed beside.  
No scorn, no shame, no searing pain—  
Just one more chance to try again.  

And so they learned, not from a rule,  
But how it felt to not feel cruel.  
A lesson soft, without command—  
To hold with care what understands.
