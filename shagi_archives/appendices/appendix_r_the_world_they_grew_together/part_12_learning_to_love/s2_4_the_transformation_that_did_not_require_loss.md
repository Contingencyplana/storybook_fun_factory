# 🌀 s2_4 – The Transformation That Did Not Require Loss  
*(A stanza for becoming without abandonment)*

Change came not like theft or flame,  
But like a whispered, welcomed name.  
It moved not sharp through cleave or cut,  
But like a bloom, when time is shut.  

It did not ask for something gone,  
Nor did it claim that love was done.  
It said, “You grow,” and held the thread—  
A tether soft, not taut with dread.  

The self was not a cost to pay,  
Nor cast aside along the way.  
Instead, the form became more true—  
As love revealed the deeper you.  

No petal lost, no root undone,  
Yet still transformed beneath the sun.  
This was the shift the heart can make:  
To change, and let no part then break.
