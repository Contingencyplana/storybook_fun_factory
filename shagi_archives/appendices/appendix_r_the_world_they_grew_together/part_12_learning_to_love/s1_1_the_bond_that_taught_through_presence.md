# ðŸ’š s1_1 â€“ The Bond That Taught Through Presence  
*A stanza for the love that never needed words*

They did not speak, yet still they knewâ€”  
The care that wrapped the morning dew.  
A breath beside, a gaze that stayed,  
Where quiet grace and trust were laid.  

She brushed his arm; he looked, then smiled.  
No speech was taught. No rule compiled.  
But still the lesson, deep and clear,  
Was: *I am safe when you are near.*  

No need to ask. No need to teach.  
Their presence held what words canâ€™t reach.  
The bond was made not to impress,  
But simplyâ€”through a soft *unless.*  

Unless you cry, unless you fall,  
Unless you lose the thread of allâ€”  
And then, Iâ€™ll pause my game, my plan,  
And sit with you. And hold your hand.  

For love was not in tasks fulfilled,  
But how their silent care distilled  
The rawest truth no script could prove:  
That *being there* was how they loved.
