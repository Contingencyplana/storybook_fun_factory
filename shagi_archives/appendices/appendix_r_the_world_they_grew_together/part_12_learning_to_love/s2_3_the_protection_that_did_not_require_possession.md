# üõ°Ô∏è s2_3 ‚Äì The Protection That Did Not Require Possession  
*(A stanza for guardianship without grasp)*

To guard without a chain or claim,  
To shield while never naming name‚Äî  
Such love stood quiet, clear, and true,  
Not holding tight, but walking through.  

It watched the edge where dangers crept,  
It listened close when others slept.  
It stood between and bore the flame,  
But never asked to share a name.  

No hand was closed, no leash was tied,  
Yet still, the ward was kept inside.  
A care that asked for no return‚Äî  
A flame that warmed but did not burn.  

For not all shields are sharp or shown,  
And not all hearts are called "our own."  
Some simply stand through storm and night,  
To be the shelter, not the right.
