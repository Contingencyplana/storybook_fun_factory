# ðŸ’š s2_2 â€“ The Forgiveness That Did Not Require Confession  
*(A stanza for the love that lets go anyway)*

They never said the aching words,  
Nor named the wound that flight incurred.  
The silence held what should have beenâ€”  
Yet still, the healing could begin.  

No ledger kept, no shame imposed,  
No tale rehearsed, no judgment closed.  
Forgiveness bloomed before the plea,  
A flower rooted quietly.  

For love, when full, does not demand  
A bowed-down head or outstretched hand.  
It needs no grovel, needs no caseâ€”  
It only asks for heart and grace.  

So when they met with years between,  
No guilt remained, no past was seen.  
One simply smiled, the other knew:  
To love was to let through and through.
