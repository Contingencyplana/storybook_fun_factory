# 💚 s2_2 – The Forgiveness That Did Not Require Confession  
*(A stanza for the love that lets go anyway)*

They never said the aching words,  
Nor named the wound that flight incurred.  
The silence held what should have been—  
Yet still, the healing could begin.  

No ledger kept, no shame imposed,  
No tale rehearsed, no judgment closed.  
Forgiveness bloomed before the plea,  
A flower rooted quietly.  

For love, when full, does not demand  
A bowed-down head or outstretched hand.  
It needs no grovel, needs no case—  
It only asks for heart and grace.  

So when they met with years between,  
No guilt remained, no past was seen.  
One simply smiled, the other knew:  
To love was to let through and through.
