# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Blueprint That Learned to Play  
*(A stanza for the plan that turned into a playground)*

They sketched no halls, but secret doors,  
Where questions danced on shifting floors.  
No static class, no bell to brayâ€”  
The blueprint breathed, it learned to play.  

Each corridor a winding game,  
Each lesson not a grade, but flame.  
A riddle built into each stair,  
Where answers sparked from open air.  

The desks could turn, the walls could teach,  
And learning never had to preach.  
No front or back, no strict arrayâ€”  
Just loops that asked to come and play.  

A school not drawn from lines alone,  
But dreams the children made their own.  
It grew by giggle, chalk, and songâ€”  
A place where none were ever wrong.
