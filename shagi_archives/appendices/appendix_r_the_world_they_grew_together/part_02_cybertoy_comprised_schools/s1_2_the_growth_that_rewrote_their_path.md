# 📘 s1_2 – The Growth That Rewrote Their Path  
*(A stanza for the moment shared steps became shared direction)*

At first the halls had planned the way,  
With gentle signs where feet should stray.  
But learning bent the printed track—  
What grew ahead did not look back.  

The charts were drawn with static ink,  
But joy refused to stay in sync.  
Each game they played, each thought they shared,  
Redrew the path the school had dared.  

A corridor became a climb,  
Its stairs reshaped by dream and time.  
A wall once plain began to bloom—  
A syllabus with room to room.  

No more the path that told them “Go,”  
But one that asked, “Which way to grow?”  
Together child and toy would weave  
New turns the blueprint could not leave.
