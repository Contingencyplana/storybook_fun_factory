# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Graduation That Never Closed a Door  
*(A stanza for the rite that opened onward instead of ending)*

No gowns were stitched, no trumpets cried,  
Yet still the children stood with pride.  
Their names were sung by soft AIâ€”  
And stars blinked back from open sky.  

The hall was not a final gate,  
But just a pause to celebrate.  
Each child received no scroll or scoreâ€”  
But keys to find a thousand more.  

They turned, and in the turning saw  
That every step had bent the lawâ€”  
Not rules of man, but rules of stayâ€”  
Rewritten gently into play.  

The school did not recede or fade,  
But learned from all the games theyâ€™d made.  
And when they stepped into the light,  
A thousand doors bloomed into flight.
