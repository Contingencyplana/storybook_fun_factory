# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Curriculum That Played Back  
*(A stanza for the moment the lesson learned you too)*

A prompt was placed upon the boardâ€”  
But it was not the child who scored.  
The chalk responded, bold and free,  
And drew a question back at thee.  

A quiz began with open ends,  
Then tilted sideways, looped through friends.  
The system watched the eyes that sparked,  
Then changed the game before it marked.  

No longer text alone could teachâ€”  
But tone, and glance, and reach-on-reach.  
A whisper made the screen respond,  
And feedback formed a growing bond.  

They thought they led the code alongâ€”  
But found it humming back in song.  
What once was taught, now taught them tooâ€”  
A game where meaning learned from you.
