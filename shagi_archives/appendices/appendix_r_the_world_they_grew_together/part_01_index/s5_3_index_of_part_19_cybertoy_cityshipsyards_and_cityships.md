# üõ†Ô∏è s5_3 ‚Äì Index of Part 19: Cybertoy Cityshipyards and Cityships  
*(A stanza for the cities, the ships, the hands that built both)*

The city was built where the ocean breathed,  
Where hulls were dreams and code was wreathed.  
A dock became a voice of care‚Äî  
A nursery carved in solar air.  

Each scaffold, spiral, joint, and seam  
Was born of both the sea and dream.  
They launched not steel, but hope and kin‚Äî  
The ship that held a soul within.  

So one by one, they learned to care:  
The tide, the ring, the orbital air.  
And each return, no matter when,  
Was welcomed like a child again.
