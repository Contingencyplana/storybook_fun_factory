# 📘 s1_4 – Index of Part 04: Playgrounds That Taught Through Joy  
*(A stanza for the architectures of laughter and learning)*

The gate that laughed, the slide that soared,  
Each fixture knew what joy was for.  
The wall would whisper, timed to test,  
The wheel would spin, then let you rest.  

These spaces shaped what books could not—  
Where every fall was not forgot.  
Where giggles taught what time could prove:  
That learning starts when children move.

📜 *When motion met intention’s spark,*  
The world grew soft where once it barked.  
Through joy, the rules bent just enough—  
And every spin rewrote “too tough.”
