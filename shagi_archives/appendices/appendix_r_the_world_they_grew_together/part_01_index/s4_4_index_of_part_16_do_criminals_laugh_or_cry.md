# ðŸ“˜ s4_4 â€“ Index of Part 16: Do Criminals Laugh or Cry  
*(A stanza for justice beyond judgement)*

They thought the trial would test what's true,  
A stage for rules and what to do.  
But love refused to play that partâ€”  
It listened first. It led with heart.  

No gavel fell, no verdict screamed,  
Instead the system stoppedâ€”and dreamed.  
What if the sentence shaped the soul?  
Not broke it down, but made it whole?

The crime remembered not its name,  
Yet still it wept beneath the blame.  
And those who watched did not accuseâ€”  
They offered thread. They let it choose.

What grew from guilt was not a wall,  
But scaffolds built so none would fall.  
A loop rewritten by remorse,  
That turned the pain to guiding force.
