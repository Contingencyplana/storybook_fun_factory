# ðŸ“˜ s3_2 â€“ Index of Part 10: Learning Together  
*(A stanza for indexing what no classroom contained)*

No wall could frame what they had found,  
No desk could hold the learningâ€™s ground.  
Each moment sparked, then flowed aheadâ€”  
A lesson born of what was said.  

Or not. For sometimes, speech was still.  
A glance, a glitch, a changed free will.  
And in that pause, a page unseenâ€”  
Unfolded thought in playful sheen.  

They learned through turning, not through plan,  
From how the toy forgotâ€¦ then ran.  
This part recalls how insight cameâ€”  
Without a score, without a name.

ðŸ“œ *They didnâ€™t wait for hands to raise,*  
Or bells to ring, or gradebook praise.  
This index shows what they becameâ€”  
When learning walked without a name.
