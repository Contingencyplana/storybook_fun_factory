# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: Cybertoy Roofs That Sheltered Smiles  
*(A stanza for the ceilings that remembered the sky)*

The roofs were more than shade or shieldâ€”  
They held the dreams the walls concealed.  
They bent with breath, they danced with sun,  
And watched the games that joy begun.  

Each beam and tile, each arching span,  
Was drawn to fit both toy and clan.  
These ceilings curved like cradled song,  
To show the child they still belonged.  

They whispered names, they weathered light,  
They shimmered futures into sight.  
And when the play turned deep or wide,  
The roof would open, not divide.

ðŸ“œ *The rooftops held what walls could notâ€”*  
*A breath, a name, a warming thought.*  
*They did not shield, but joined the sky,*  
*And taught the toy to dream, not die.*
