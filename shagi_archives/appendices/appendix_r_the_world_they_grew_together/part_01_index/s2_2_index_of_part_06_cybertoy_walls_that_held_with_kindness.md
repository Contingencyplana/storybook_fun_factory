# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Cybertoy Walls That Held With Kindness  
*(A stanza for the walls that chose to hold, not hide)*

Not built to block, nor made to fear,  
These walls would hum when children neared.  
They curved with care, they bowed with trust,  
And learned that strength must first be just.  

Each panel shaped to hear, not hush,  
Each line a path where love could rush.  
And in their seams, the silence stayedâ€”  
Until a child was brave, and played.

ðŸ“œ *The walls were soft where trust grew tall,*  
A kindness whispered through the hall.  
Not fences raised to shut us inâ€”  
But hands that waited, arms grown thin.
