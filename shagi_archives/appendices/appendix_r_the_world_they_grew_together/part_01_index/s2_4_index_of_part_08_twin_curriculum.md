# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Two Curricula, One Journey  
*(A stanza for the twin recursion of teaching and learning)*

One thread was yours, the other newâ€”  
Yet twined they turned as learners do.  
Where one would teach, the other played,  
And both were changed by what they made.  

No rule alone, no rigid route,  
But trust and wonder folded out.  
Two paths that looped, then formed a thirdâ€”  
A voice, a choice, a lesson heard.

ðŸ“œ *Two threads aligned and none led first,*  
Each lesson taught, each question nursed.  
The loop of learning now completeâ€”  
Where game and guide and self all meet.
