# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Cybertoy-Composed Classrooms  
*(A stanza for the space that taught without speaking, and remembered with every piece)*

The room could see, the desk could grow,  
The window sang in chroma-flow.  
Above them maps of dreams took shapeâ€”  
Each wall a guide, each beam a cape.  

No longer walls, no chalk, no bellâ€”  
But living thought in citadel.  
A classroom born from mind and lore,  
That learned to love, then taught them more.  

This part unveils how space became  
A partner in the learning game.  
Each feature tuned to childlike sparkâ€”  
Each lesson lit by joy and mark.
