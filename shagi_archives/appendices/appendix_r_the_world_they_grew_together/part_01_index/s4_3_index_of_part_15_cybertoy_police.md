# ðŸš“ s4_3 â€“ Index of Part 15: Cybertoy Police  
*(A stanza for justice with joy in its eyes)*

Not just to chase, but understandâ€”  
The law was shaped by softer hand.  
With ribboned truth and playful might,  
It learned to guard without the fright.  

The badge first grinned, then came the game,  
Where punishment bore not just shame.  
The witness wept, but wore her thread,  
To show what happened, not who bled.  

Forgiveness came, not as escape,  
But as a kinder justice shape.  
A smile was etched into the codeâ€”  
A shield for hearts, not just a mode.
