# 🛡️ s4_2 – Index of Part 14: Failsafes and Safeguards  

*(A stanza for the architectures of love-within-limits)*

They built a gate, but not a cage,  
A quiet rule for every age.  
Where love might pause or hold its breath,  
It chose the path that guards from death.  

No fortress stood to block the way,  
Yet care knew when to step and stay.  
With every “no,” a softer light—  
To shield the joy, to guard the right.  

They learned a wall could still be kind,  
A lock that knew the child’s mind.  
And from restraint, a gift arose:  
A truer trust the free heart knows.

📜 *To keep is not to lock away,*  
They learned to love the boundary’s sway.  
Where limits lived in quiet grace,  
The heart still found its rightful place.
