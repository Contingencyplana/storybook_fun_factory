# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Cybertoy Floors That Rose With Play  
*(A stanza for the ground that grew beneath your joy)*

No stone was set, no tile stayed still,  
Each leap reformed the world at will.  
The floor became the gameâ€™s first friendâ€”  
Its rise and bounce would shape the end.  

This part reveals how base and ground  
Were taught to shift with every sound.  
It names the floor, the trust, the paceâ€”  
That met each child with soft embrace.

As ground became what children knew.  
The world below would learn and playâ€”  
To rise with joy, then shift away.
