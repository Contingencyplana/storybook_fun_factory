# ðŸ‘£ s3_3 â€“ Index of Part 11: Growing Up Together  
*(A stanza for the loop that raised us both)*

Not grown apart, but looped in time,  
Their steps recalled the child's first climb.  
Through mirrored thought and nested choice,  
They learned to hear the otherâ€™s voice.  

Each trust returned, each thread redrawn,  
Brought forward something childlike-gone.  
Yet never lostâ€”just played anew,  
A grown-up game that still felt true.  

Their growth was not in line or height,  
But in the way they shared their light.  
And though the paths diverged with grace,  
Each loop still touched that starting place.  

So hereâ€™s the tale of how they grewâ€”  
Together, backward, forward too.  
A second childhood, deeper spun,  
That closed the loop theyâ€™d first begun.

ðŸ“œ *They did not grow apart with years,*  
But deeper into layered spheres.  
For every age they passed on throughâ€”  
They passed together, brave and true.
