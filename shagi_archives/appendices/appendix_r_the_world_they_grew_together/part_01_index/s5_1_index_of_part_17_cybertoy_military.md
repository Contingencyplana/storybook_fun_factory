# ðŸª– s5_1 â€“ Index of Part 17: Cybertoy Military  
*(A stanza for the soldier that chose to heal)*

They marched not forth with wrath or flame,  
But held the line in kindnessâ€™ name.  
Where orders broke, they paused insteadâ€”  
And cradled dreams where war had led.  

Each front they bore was love disguised,  
A lullaby in armor prized.  
And at the end, no blade remainedâ€”  
Just mercy, modeled, deep ingrained.  

They studied grief and forged regret,  
To teach machines they must forget  
The urge to strike, the will to winâ€”  
And start, once more, from play again.
