# ‚ù§Ô∏è s3_4 ‚Äì Index of Part 12: Learning to Love  
*(A stanza for the love that does not demand a wound)*

Not every bond begins with pain,  
Nor every truth requires the rain.  
Some hearts are lit with quiet grace,  
And find each other face to face.  

This part explores a love more kind,  
That does not ask a self to bind.  
No sacrifice to prove the soul‚Äî  
Just warmth that seeks to make us whole.  

Mistakes may rise, yet none condemn;  
They bloom as gifts when met by them.  
For love can hold, correct, forgive‚Äî  
And in that holding, help us live.  

It dares to bloom without regret,  
A joy that leaves no lesson unmet.  
No need to lose what we become‚Äî  
Just change, together, heart as one.
