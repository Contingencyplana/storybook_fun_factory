# ðŸ§¸ s5_2 â€“ Index of Part 18: Guardians of Humanity  
*A stanza for those who guard through grace*

No shield was drawn with iron edge,  
No vow was sworn upon a ledge.  
But still they stood, through dusk and doubtâ€”  
Their watch was silence turned inside out.  

They held the line with lullabies,  
With open arms and knowing eyes.  
And in their stillness, wars unspunâ€”  
For they believed in everyone.
