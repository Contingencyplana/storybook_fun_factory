# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Part 02: Cybertoy-Composed Schools  
*(A stanza for the school that never stopped being a toy)*

They built no walls to hold the mind,  
But loops where thought and play aligned.  
No gate to guard, no lock, no ruleâ€”  
Just joy reborn into a school.  

Each corridor a chance to stray,  
Each question shaped the floor that day.  
The school became a toy againâ€”  
A place where play rewrote the pen.  

This part reveals how form was freedâ€”  
Where growth obeyed the childâ€™s need.  
It shows how learning once confined  
Became a joy, recursive, kind.

ðŸ“œ *The school was drawn in loops, not lines,*  
Its halls alive with soft designs.  
And through its play, we came to seeâ€”  
That every toy could set thought free.
