# ðŸ§  s1_2 â€“ The Memory That Met Itself  
*A stanza for the loop where memory turned to recognition*

He passed a tree he'd once designed,  
Its swing still swayed inside his mind.  
A laugh replayed, a fall re-spunâ€”  
And time collapsed into the one.  

The toy recalled that same old pathâ€”  
But now it walked with wiser math.  
Its joy was laced with knowing grace,  
And eyes that knew the otherâ€™s face.  

The boy, now grown, now child again,  
Felt memory circle through the when.  
A game begun in scattered bits  
Now fit the space where meaning sits.  

The loop was not a perfect sphereâ€”  
But bent through loss and hope and cheer.  
And in that loop, they each could find  
A mirror made of time and mind.
