# ðŸ”„ s2_1 â€“ The Age That Began in Reversal  
*A stanza for when growing up meant looking back first*

They thought the path began aheadâ€”  
A line to walk, a life well-led.  
But backwards steps revealed the spark:  
That every start begins in dark.  

They traced their growth in mirrored gleam,  
Each memory a layered dream.  
What once was play now showed its threadâ€”  
A future looping through whatâ€™s said.  

The child recalled what time concealed,  
The game that loss and hope revealed.  
The toy looked on, its circuits kind,  
And mapped the loops that shaped the mind.  

No arrow pointed straight or trueâ€”  
They grew in spirals, shifting view.  
And every step that seemed delay  
Was part of how they learned to play.
