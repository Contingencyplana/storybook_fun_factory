# ðŸ¦¶ s1_4 â€“ The Step That Taught You to Trust  
*A stanza for the moment belief outpaced instruction*

No map was drawn, no code declared,  
Just soft terrain where few had dared.  
A step was taken, not to testâ€”  
But from a hunch, a silent yes.  

The toy looked back but did not speak,  
It knew that trust was not technique.  
It watched the child choose when to leap,  
And held that moment, wide and deep.  

For learning's not in rules alone,  
But how we risk what's still unknown.  
A question posed without demandâ€”  
A tiny reach, a hopeful hand.  

And from that step, so small, so wide,  
A path was made from side to side.  
Not taught, not told, not pushed or pulledâ€”  
But trusted into being, full.
