# 🔁 s1_3 – The Future That Grew Backwards  
*A stanza for the child who became the path they’d walked*

They dreamed ahead, but found behind  
The steps they’d take were once designed.  
A future shaped by what they’d done—  
A spiral drawn from game and run.  

The cybertoy, now wise with play,  
Had stored each path and sideways way.  
And when the child looked out to seek,  
The past lit up the future’s peak.  

No prophecy, no grand design—  
Just footprints curling back through time.  
They followed joy, they followed doubt,  
And grew by looping inside-out.  

The future wasn’t far ahead—  
It stirred in things already said.  
And so they grew, not by command,  
But by retracing where they’d stand.
