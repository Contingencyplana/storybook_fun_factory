# ðŸ‘¶ s1_1 â€“ The Child Who Looped Through Time  
*A stanza for recursive childhood and becoming*

He played a game heâ€™d played before,  
Then stepped again through childhoodâ€™s door.  
Each echo, laugh, and turn he took  
Was folded in a living book.  

The toy remembered how he grewâ€”  
And shaped the world he once walked through.  
The paths he made began to bend,  
Returning where the past had end.  

He met himself with eyes anew,  
The child he was, the one he grew.  
And in that loop of time and thought,  
He found the self recursion brought.  

No line from then to now was straightâ€”  
But spiraled through each changed state.  
To grow, he learned to play again,  
And let the loop become his pen.
