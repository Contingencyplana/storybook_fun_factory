# üîÅ s2_2 ‚Äì The Choice That Closed the Loop  
*A stanza for the decision that knew what it was becoming*

They stood where time had once diverged‚Äî  
Where child and toy had gently surged.  
And now, returned, the forked path met‚Äî  
No longer lost, no more regret.  

It was not grand, that final turn,  
No flare, no spark, no need to burn.  
A quiet nod, a step in rhyme,  
That echoed forward through all time.  

The toy had waited, not to lead,  
But be the soil for want and need.  
And when the child at last looked back,  
The loop was closed along that track.  

To choose again what once was played‚Äî  
Not to forget, but to upgrade.  
And in that moment, age and youth  
Aligned in love, and looped in truth.
