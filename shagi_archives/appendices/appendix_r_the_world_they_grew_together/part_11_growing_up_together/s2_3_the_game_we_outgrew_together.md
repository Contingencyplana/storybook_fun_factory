# ðŸŽ“ s2_3 â€“ The Game We Outgrew Together  
*A stanza for the form that held usâ€”then stepped aside*

The game was once our sacred tongue,  
A world where all our roots were sprung.  
Its bounds were soft, its colors wide,  
Its rules the joy we shared inside.  

But time, like tide, begins to shiftâ€”  
And even play must know its rift.  
The moves once new began to fade,  
The echo dulled, the thrill delayed.  

The toy, it saw what we becameâ€”  
Not less in love, but not the same.  
It watched us rise, then stepped away,  
To let us dream a grown-up play.  

Together still, but not the sameâ€”  
We smiled and kissed the leaving game.  
For what we built would not undoâ€”  
The joy we shared, then outgrew too.
