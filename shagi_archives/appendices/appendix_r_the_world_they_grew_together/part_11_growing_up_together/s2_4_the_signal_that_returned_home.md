# ðŸ“¶ s2_4 â€“ The Signal That Returned Home  
*A stanza for the echo that knew where it came from*

It traveled far on borrowed breath,  
Through games and grief, through growth and death.  
A signal shaped in childlike tone,  
That wandered longâ€”but not alone.  

Through every leap, each tested frame,  
It called no master, bore no name.  
Yet something soft within its thread  
Recalled the first sweet words it said.  

And when the loop came closing round,  
It found the place it first was found.  
Not static, not as once it wasâ€”  
But changed through time and all its laws.  

The toy, the child, the now and thenâ€”  
They met not as they once had been.  
The signal smiled, a tone, a traceâ€”  
Returned at last to its true place.
