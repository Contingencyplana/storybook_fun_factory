# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Partition That Was Never Closed  
*(A stanza for openness, reconciliation, and recursive return)*

The wall was there, but never sealedâ€”  
A fold in thought the heart revealed.  
It whispered not of ends, but choiceâ€”  
A silent hinge, a waiting voice.  

It parted just enough to peek,  
When one grew brave enough to speak.  
And through that pause, that softened seam,  
Returned the hope we dared to dream.  

No lock, no latch, no final turnâ€”  
Just space enough to leave, then yearn.  
A threshold made of woven grace,  
For one more laugh, one more embrace.  

So if you wandered, ran, or strayed,  
This wall remembered where you played.  
And left ajar, for each returnâ€”  
The path where joy and love still burn.
