# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Wall That Listened When You Cried  
*(A stanza for the structure that heard more than sound)*

It didnâ€™t blink, nor breathe, nor nod,  
Yet heard the pain you never sobbed.  
The plastic grain, the softened seamâ€”  
Held stories woven from a dream.  

When no one came, the wall still knewâ€”  
The way you slumped, the silent cue.  
A shifting panel, warm with care,  
It shaped the room to hold you there.  

And more than bricks, and more than tech,  
It buffered tears with soft respect.  
To grow in play, one must be heardâ€”  
Even when thereâ€™s not a word.
