# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Brick That Hummed the Childâ€™s Song  
*(A stanza for resonance, memory, and encoded comfort)*

One brick, no different to the eye,  
Yet held a hum that would not die.  
Not loud, not sharp, not made to teachâ€”  
But tuned to lull, and never preach.  

It sang of stars you used to name,  
Of puddle-songs and shadow-games.  
Its frequencyâ€”your memoryâ€™s thread,  
A lullaby the quiet fed.  

It matched your hums from years before,  
And learned the way you used to snore.  
It didnâ€™t try to overwriteâ€”  
Just echoed back your earliest light.  

So when you leaned against that space,  
The wall became a warm embrace.  
And through that toneâ€”a nested truth:  
The child remains inside the roof.
