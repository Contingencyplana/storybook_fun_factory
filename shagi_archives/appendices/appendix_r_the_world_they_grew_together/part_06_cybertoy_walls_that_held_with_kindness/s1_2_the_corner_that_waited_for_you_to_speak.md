# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Corner That Waited for You to Speak  
*(A stanza for silence, safety, and the patience of walls)*

One corner knew just when to hush,  
When not to pry, when not to rush.  
It held its breath, it dimmed its light,  
So you could weep without a fright.  

It did not flash, it did not beep,  
It simply listened soft and deep.  
Its circuit stilled, its focus wideâ€”  
A shrine for truths we learn to hide.  

In padded edge and gentle slope,  
It carved the shape of grief and hope.  
And when the voice inside grew brave,  
It waited there, a vault, a wave.  

So not all walls are built to bindâ€”  
Some cradle loss, and wait, and find.
