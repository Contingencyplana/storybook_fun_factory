# ❓ s1_3 – The Question That Outgrew the Lesson  
*A stanza for when curiosity changed the rules*

A hand went up. The toy stood still.  
The answer paused upon the hill.  
The child asked more than truth could give—  
And what they asked began to live.  

It left the page, it crossed the floor,  
It opened doors not asked before.  
A simple “why?” began to spin  
The game, the class, the world within.  

The toy rewrote what it had known,  
The child reshaped what had been shown.  
The question curved, became a guide—  
A voice that hummed from deep inside.  

Not every query found reply,  
But still they asked, and so did I.  
And learning bloomed where none had planned—  
A lesson shaped by open hand.
