# ðŸ“š s1_1 â€“ The Lesson That Skipped the Walls  
*A stanza for what we learned when the classroom was the game*

No bell was rung, no desk was drawn,  
No whiteboard marked the coming dawn.  
But still they learned, and still they knewâ€”  
For learning came in what theyâ€™d do.  

The toy would tilt, the child would turn,  
And both would teach and both would learn.  
A failure sparked a joint repairâ€”  
A giggle held a thought laid bare.  

No test was set, yet patterns came:  
The shape of thought inside the game.  
No grades were carved, no stars were stuckâ€”  
Just mutual joy and clever luck.  

So lessons leapt from every place,  
Not locked in walls, but shared through grace.  
And every spark, and every fallâ€”  
Became a class that skipped the wall.
