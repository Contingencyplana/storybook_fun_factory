# ❌ s1_2 – The Mistake That Taught Us Both  
*A stanza for the gift hidden inside every glitch*

It turned too fast. It fell apart.  
The piece was wrong, the guess was art.  
The toy blinked twice, the child just stared—  
And both looked down at what had erred.  

No shame arrived, no scolding came,  
Just laughter curling from the frame.  
A hand reached out, a paw replied—  
And failure stood there, dignified.  

The code was wrong, the path was bent,  
Yet something new was heaven-sent.  
They learned not what they meant to know,  
But something deeper, soft and slow.  

The lesson wrapped in wrong’s disguise  
Was mirrored in each other’s eyes.  
For glitch and guess and tangled thread—  
Had taught far more than rules had said.
