# ✨ s1_4 – The Answer That Waited for Neither  
*A stanza for the truths that moved first*

They asked, “What makes the answer true?”  
But truth had moved before they knew.  
The toy had turned before command,  
The child had learned before the hand.  

No signal told the play to start,  
No script had cued the change of heart.  
Yet both had pivoted as one—  
As if the choice had come, then gone.  

It wasn’t taught, it wasn’t led,  
It wasn’t sourced from what was said.  
The leap was made without a call—  
No logic mapped, no protocol.  

The lesson here was not in rule,  
Nor textbook, teacher, test, or school.  
It simply leapt—a spark, a flame—  
And both were changed, though none could name.
