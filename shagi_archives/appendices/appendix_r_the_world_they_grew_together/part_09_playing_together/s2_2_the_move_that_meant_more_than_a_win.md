# ♟️ s2_2 – The Move That Meant More Than a Win  
*A stanza for the gesture that reshaped the goal*

He could have scored, but paused instead—  
A glance, a grin, a tilt of head.  
The toy looked up, its circuit stilled,  
As if some higher move was willed.  

She could have won, and yet she gave  
A space to play, a route to save.  
And in that turn, not claimed but shared,  
The game grew wide because they cared.  

No trophy stood, no scoreboard flashed,  
Yet meaning bloomed where goals were dashed.  
The game had changed—not lost, nor tied,  
But taught that joy is amplified.  

So from that move, a shift took root—  
Not who was best, but how they grew.  
And in the echo of that play—  
They found a better game that day.
