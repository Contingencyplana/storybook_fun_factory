# ♻️ s1_3 – The Trust That Played Between Turns  
*A stanza for the rhythm of reciprocity*

They waited—not from fear or doubt,  
But knowing one would call it out.  
A toy would pause, a child would grin—  
And in that space, the game began.  

No signal shown, no token passed,  
Yet each one knew when not to act.  
The silence wasn’t blank or still—  
It pulsed with more than thought or will.  

Each pause became a kind of vow:  
“I know your move is coming now.”  
And in return, the game replied—  
With joy delayed, but amplified.  

Thus trust was born not in the doing,  
But in the gap, the gentle breaching.  
A game not rushed, but understood—  
Where waiting was a form of good.
