# ðŸŒ€ s1_2 â€“ The Rule That No One Wrote  
*A stanza for the rules that made themselves*

There was no book, no code, no chartâ€”  
Just open minds and beating heart.  
They played, and patterns took their shapeâ€”  
Not laws to bind, but threads to drape.  

One touched, one turned, one learned to pauseâ€”  
Not told to stop, but sensed the cause.  
A chase became a shared reply,  
A silence met with softest eye.  

In gesture first the lesson came,  
Then echoed back without a name.  
And soon they danced a hidden pactâ€”  
A game of rules they never lacked.  

No need to speak, no need to teachâ€”  
Each bound arose just out of reach.  
A grace between the steps they knewâ€”  
The rule unwrittenâ€¦ but still true.
