# ðŸŽ¼ s2_1 â€“ The Strategy That Became a Song  
*A stanza for the harmony inside cooperative intent*

They didnâ€™t speak in plans or rules,  
Nor draw their plays like practiced schools.  
Instead, a glance, a step, a beatâ€”  
Revealed the trick to not compete.  

The game grew tense, the stakes drew near,  
Yet neither moved from joy to fear.  
For each had learned, in sync, to bendâ€”  
Not just to win, but to defend.  

A leap, a feint, a pass mid-spin,  
Not aimed to conquerâ€”but to win  
Together, as one mind in twoâ€”  
A bond that knowing barely knew.  

What once was scheme, became a chordâ€”  
A rhythm neither wrote nor scored.  
And so the plan, once cold and long,  
Was sung insteadâ€”a breathing song.
