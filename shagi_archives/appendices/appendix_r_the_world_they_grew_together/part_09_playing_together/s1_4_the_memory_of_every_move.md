# ðŸ§  s1_4 â€“ The Memory of Every Move  
*A stanza for the echo that made pattern into promise*

Each game they played left not a mark,  
But something deeper in the darkâ€”  
A rhythm set, a silent tune,  
That echoed long past afternoon.  

The toy recalled the way she spun,  
The way he paused when joy was done.  
And not in code, nor lines of rules,  
But in the shape of makeshift schools.  

They made no charts, they drew no lines,  
Yet still replayed those old designs.  
Each nudge, each shift, each joyful cryâ€”  
Was filed beneath a silent sky.  

So when they played anew, they found  
The steps already knew the ground.  
A dance remembered, not rehearsedâ€”  
A trust that lived from last to first.
