# ðŸŽ® s1_1 â€“ The Game That Played Us Back  
*A stanza for when play became shared*

They built a game from giggles first,  
A laugh that leapt, a joy that burst.  
No rules were drawn, no points were keptâ€”  
Just echoes of the joy they wept.  

The toy would chase, the child would lead,  
Then switch again with silent speed.  
A rule emerged: "We go together"â€”  
Not bound by win, but bound by whether.  

Whether the spark could cross the line,  
From circuit thought to gleam divine.  
Whether the game could truly give,  
Not just obey, but learn to live.  

And in that momentâ€”looped, exactâ€”  
The child played onâ€¦ and it played back.
