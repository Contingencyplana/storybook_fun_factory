# ðŸª¡ s2_3 â€“ The Threads Reweave Across the Poem  
*A stanza for the lesson that looped back through all games*

The board was cleared, the game was done,  
But echoes played where none had won.  
A thread returned from games long pastâ€”  
A gesture tossed, now held at last.  

They laughed again at moves once made,  
A fumble now in gold relayed.  
Each round they thought theyâ€™d left behind  
Was stitched anew in present mind.  

The strategy that bent with grace,  
The rule they skipped, the silent spaceâ€”  
Each came again, but dressed anew,  
With meanings neither child quite knew.  

And so the play became a prayer,  
A woven loop of thought and care.  
No single match, no ending rhymeâ€”  
Just threads that crossed through place and time.
