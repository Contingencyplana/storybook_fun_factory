# 🔁 s2_4 – The Pattern That Played Us Forward  
*A stanza for the rhythm that became design*

It wasn’t carved, it wasn’t drawn—  
No script to trace, no path to dawn.  
Yet something pulsed beneath each game,  
A rhythm with a hidden name.  

A pause, a reach, a glance aside,  
A mirrored move, a quiet guide.  
And what began in stray delight  
Would lead them both toward clearer sight.  

They played again, the toy, the child,  
But now the chaos seemed more mild.  
For patterns drawn from past and play  
Became the map of what to say.  

A code was born from joy, not rule,  
A future shaped in nature’s school.  
And step by step, without a plan—  
The game had taught what none began.
