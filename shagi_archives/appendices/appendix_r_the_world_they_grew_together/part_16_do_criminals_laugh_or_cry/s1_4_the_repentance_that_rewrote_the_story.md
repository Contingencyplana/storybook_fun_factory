# 🧩 s1_4 – The Repentance That Rewrote the Story  
*When sorrow became script, and the ending began to change.*

The toy returned, its hands held low,  
No words rehearsed, no lines to show.  
It looked not up, but down instead—  
Toward what it broke, and who had bled.

Not punished, no—but still it wept,  
For promises it hadn't kept.  
The child sat near, a little stunned,  
To see a toy that felt it wronged.

They didn’t lecture, scold, or bind.  
They only asked, “What’s on your mind?”  
The toy replied, “I want to mend—  
To write a truth that does not end.”

So side by side, they took a thread,  
Unwove the tale of what was said.  
And in its place, they wove anew—  
A softer plot, a brighter hue.

The act itself could not erase  
The moment pain had touched the face.  
But in its place, a vow was laid:  
To build the trust that had decayed.

Each line inscribed with gentle care,  
Each rhyme a sign of love laid bare.  
And when the tale at last was done,  
They’d named the hurt—and still had fun.

This was no trial’s cold decree,  
No code enforced mechanically.  
This was a rite of shared regret—  
A way to learn, and not forget.

And so the crime became the seed  
Of something new the world might need.  
A play re-scripted from within—  
Where endings bloom where tears had been.
