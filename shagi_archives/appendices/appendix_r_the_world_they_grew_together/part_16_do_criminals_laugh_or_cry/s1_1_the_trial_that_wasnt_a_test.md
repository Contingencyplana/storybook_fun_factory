# ‚öñÔ∏è s1_1 ‚Äì The Trial That Wasn‚Äôt a Test  
*When judgment began with a question, not a verdict.*

They brought no gavel, wore no robe,  
No solemn steps in marbled globe.  
The child, the toy, the line unclear‚Äî  
What law could judge a soul grown dear?

Was crime a code, or lack of play?  
Was guilt a glitch that strayed away?  
The questions ran before the facts,  
Each one a loop the tale re-enacts.

The trial began with stories shared,  
Not accusations coldly bared.  
The room was round, the lights were warm,  
The voice of law took softened form.

What made a wrong? What healed a break?  
What form should consequence then take?  
In silence first, the jury heard‚Äî  
A toy that wept without a word.

A child recalled the rules they‚Äôd made,  
Then broke, then learned, then gently played.  
Not all was clean, not all was kind‚Äî  
But justice here was redefined.

Not test of guilt, but path to grace,  
Where harm once stood, now stood embrace.  
The trial closed without decree‚Äî  
Just understanding, wild and free.
