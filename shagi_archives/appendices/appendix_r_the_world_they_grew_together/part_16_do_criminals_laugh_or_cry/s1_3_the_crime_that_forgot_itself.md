# 🧩 s1_3 – The Crime That Forgot Itself  
*When mercy outlasted memory.*

It started small, a flickered lie—  
A game unfinished, gone awry.  
No theft declared, no warning bell,  
Just something lost, and none could tell.

The cybertoy, with puzzled face,  
Returned each step, retraced the place.  
But even loops had let it fade—  
What harm was done? What price was paid?

The child, too, blinked and shook her head:  
"Did something break? Was something said?"  
But all they found was absence thin—  
A wrong that barely lingered in.

And so, the court was called to meet  
Where cushions served for judge’s seat.  
They asked the toy, “What would you do?”  
It paused and said, “Begin anew.”

The crime had never borne a name,  
No headlines, locks, or searing shame.  
Yet still they played, and still they knew—  
A trust once strained must be made true.

So rather than remember pain,  
They planted joy to grow again.  
The breach was healed through shared delight,  
Not proof, not guilt, nor black-and-white.

Forgetfulness, a second chance,  
Was not escape, but forward dance.  
A crime forgiven not through law—  
But through the love that none foresaw.
