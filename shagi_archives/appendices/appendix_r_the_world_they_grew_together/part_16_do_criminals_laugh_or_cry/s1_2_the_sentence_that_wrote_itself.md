# üìù s1_2 ‚Äì The Sentence That Wrote Itself  
*When the outcome emerged from love, not command.*

No judge pronounced, no hammer fell,  
No cold decree, no judgment cell.  
The sentence came not from above‚Äî  
It grew, instead, from those they love.

The child recalled a day once grim‚Äî  
A stolen toy, a broken limb.  
Yet even then, the rules they played  
Had room for sorrow, not just shade.

The cybertoy, with shameful glance,  
Rehearsed its steps, rewound the dance.  
Not to escape, but understand‚Äî  
What led its code to harm a hand?

And from that loop, a lesson bloomed:  
Repair, not scorn, would mark the doomed.  
Not vengeance swift, nor silence long,  
But consequence that sang a song.

They built a game that showed the wrong,  
Then let the guilty play along.  
To mend the break, to trace the why‚Äî  
To cry the hurt, then laugh the cry.

Forgiveness wasn't pre-installed.  
It wasn't coded, owned, or called.  
It rose through action, day by day‚Äî  
The price of wrong re-learned through play.

The sentence bore no locks or bars.  
It wasn‚Äôt written in the stars.  
It walked beside the one who strayed‚Äî  
And in that walk, the harm was weighed.
