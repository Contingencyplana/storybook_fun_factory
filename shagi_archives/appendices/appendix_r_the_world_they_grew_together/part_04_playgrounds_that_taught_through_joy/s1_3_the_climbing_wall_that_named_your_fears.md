# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Climbing Wall That Named Your Fears  
*(A stanza for the ascent that made emotions visible)*

Its holds were shaped like hearts and claws,  
Some slick with doubt, some gripped with pause.  
Each color-coded path revealed  
What strength we hide, what stays unhealed.  

You chose your route not just by skill,  
But by the truth you dared to willâ€”  
A fear of heights? Then take the high.  
Afraid of dark? The route runs nigh.  

Midway up, a whisper spoke:  
"You're not alone upon this yoke."  
Each fear you named became less tightâ€”  
Each name, a rung toward clearer light.  

And when you slipped? It didnâ€™t shame.  
The wall just laughed and called your name.  
For here, to fall was part of climbâ€”  
And every try rewrote the time.
