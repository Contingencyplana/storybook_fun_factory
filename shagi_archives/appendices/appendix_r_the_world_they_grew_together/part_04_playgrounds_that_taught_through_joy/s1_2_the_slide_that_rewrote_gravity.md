# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Slide That Rewrote Gravity  
*(A stanza for the spiral where physics and play learned to dance)*

It didnâ€™t pull you straight or fast,  
But slowed you down so joy would last.  
A spiral steeped in giggling curves,  
That bent the laws for childlike nerves.  

Each turn was tuned to laughterâ€™s rate,  
Each dip designed to recalibrate.  
Not downward, noâ€”this slide would spin  
Your thoughts and fears from deep within.  

A pause near halfway held your weight,  
To ask if now might be too lateâ€”  
Then dipped you gently through delight,  
And flung you out into the light.  

It taught that fall need not mean fear,  
That down could rise and far feel near.  
The slide, they said, could bend the skyâ€”  
And children learned that so could I.
