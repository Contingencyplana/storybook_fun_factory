# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Gate That Giggled When You Pushed It  
*(A stanza for the laughter that opened every lesson)*

It did not creak, it did not groan,  
No rusted hinge, no weary moan.  
It giggled loud when pushed just rightâ€”  
A spark of joy, a note of light.  

Its frame was shaped by hands that cared,  
Each rivet placed where stories stared.  
A thousand childrenâ€™s grins were stored  
In circuits hidden, joy restored.  

The gate knew names, and games, and cheers,  
And opened wide to soothe all fears.  
Each step beyond, a world beganâ€”  
Where playgrounds taught more than a plan.  

It never locked, yet knew to pause,  
To wait for thought, to sense a cause.  
For not all gates must guard with mightâ€”  
Some simply laugh, then bloom with light.
