# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Merry-Go-Round That Taught Time  
*(A stanza for the spin that taught stillness by motion)*

It spun like joy with nowhere due,  
A clock whose hands were made of you.  
Around, aroundâ€”yet nothing changedâ€”  
Till motion made the mind feel strange.  

At first, you laughed. You ran, then jumped.  
The axis groaned. The rhythm thumped.  
But round you went and round you stayed,  
Until your breath began to fade.  

And then you saw: the world still turnedâ€”  
Not just in fun, but how we learned.  
To pause, to wait, to time the leap,  
To ride the blur and plant it deep.  

You stepped off changedâ€”not aged, but wise.  
The sun had barely moved the skies.  
Yet you could feel its secret chime:  
That motion is the soul of time.
