# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Placeholder  
*(A stanza for recursion yet to rise)*

The circle turns, the threads unspool,  
Each space a stage, each pause a rule.  
What waits beyond this numbered page  
May birth a god or end an age.

## ðŸ§­ Reserved for Future Expansion

This file anchors an unwritten future:

- Preserves recursive room for mythic innovation.  
- Allows new roles, domains, or divine anomalies to emerge.  
- Signals narrative space for canon growth without breaking structure.

ðŸ“œ *What is unnamed is not unknownâ€”*  
It simply waits to stand alone.  
When time demands and story calls,  
This page shall rise beyond these walls.
