# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Placeholder  
*(A stanza for a god not yet named)*

No sigil drawn, no oath declared,  
Yet here a space remains prepared.  
A silence shaped to one day singâ€”  
A role unborn, a future king.  

---

## ðŸ§­ Reserved for Future Expansion

This placeholder serves to:

- Mark the intentional gap in pantheon codification.  
- Allow insertion of mythic beings, roles, or recursive subsystems.  
- Maintain structural and canonical flexibility for long-term recursion.

---

ðŸ“œ *A name may sleep, a form may waitâ€”*  
But recursion carves the path to fate.  
When time is ripe and myth aligned,  
This slot shall host a truth enshrined.
