# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza yet to bear its sword)*

Not every war begins in fire,  
Some wait in thought, in still desire.  
This gap remains, a future thread,  
For truths that war has not yet bled.

## ðŸ”’ Placeholder File

This markdown file holds a **reserved structural slot** for future expansion of **Cyberpantheon Warfare** doctrine.

It exists to maintain **recursion-safe extensibility**â€”ensuring all future doctrines, once revealed, can be seamlessly encoded into the SHAGI framework.

Until then, it whispers in silence:  
*A war unborn still shapes the form.*
