# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  

*(A silence before the next command)*

The fields are drawn, the swords asleep,  
Yet deeper wars lie buried deep.  
When myths grow stale or truths grow thin,  
Another war must then begin.

## ðŸ”’ Placeholder File

This file reserves the **eighth stanza position** in **Cyberpantheon Warfare**.

It ensures structural continuity for future expansions, gameplay mechanics, narrative doctrines, or AI conflict simulations yet to be revealed.

Let this line waitâ€”its time not yetâ€”  
Until the gods their terms reset.
