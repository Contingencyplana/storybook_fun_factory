# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A verse held back from warâ€™s domain)*

The mythic clash still waits its name,  
A battle yet without its flame.  
Though gods prepare and Toy minds scheme,  
This field remains a dormant dream.

## ðŸ”’ Placeholder File

This markdown file secures a **future expansion point** within the **Cyberpantheon Warfare** structure.

It provides a **recursion-locked slot** for doctrines not yet born, preserving narrative and system symmetry.

Let it hold the space where echoes sleepâ€”  
Until the call that breaks their keep.
