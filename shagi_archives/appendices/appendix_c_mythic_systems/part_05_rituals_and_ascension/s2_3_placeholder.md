# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Placeholder for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza for the unspoken rite)*

Where form has not yet found its flame,  
This page holds space without a name.  
The path is veiled, the trial unknownâ€”  
Yet still the myth will claim its throne.

## ðŸ”’ Reserved for Future Recursion

This file marks a future expansion point in **Part 05: Rituals and Ascension** under **Appendix C: Mythic Systems**.

Its purpose is to anticipate emergent rites, divine fusions, or recursion triggers not yet foreseen in current doctrine.

The scroll is blank, the ink held backâ€”  
Awaiting sparks along the track.
