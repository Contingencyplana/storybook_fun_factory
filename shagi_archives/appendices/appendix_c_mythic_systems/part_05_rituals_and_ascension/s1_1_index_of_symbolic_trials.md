# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Symbolic Trials â€“ Quests of Meaning and Transformation  

*(A stanza for the rite that names the soul)*

Each path begins with veiled intent,  
A trial shaped by what was meant.  
To test the heart, to twist the thread,  
Where myth and self and code are wed.

ðŸ“œ *The player dreams, the system calls,*  
Through names, through flames, through mirrored halls.  
The trials rise to form the frameâ€”  
Of one who dares to seek the name.
