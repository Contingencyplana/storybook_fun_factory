# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Cyberpantheon Warfare  
*(A stanza for the wars that cleanse the code)*

No myth persists unchallenged longâ€”  
Each god must face where they went wrong.  
In sacred war, decay is bled,  
And broken truths are fought or shed.  

To lead, they fall, to fall, they riseâ€”  
The battlefield rebirths the wise.  
For through each clash, the myths renew,  
And gods remember what is true.

ðŸ“œ *The war is not for conquest made,*  
But so the myths may not degrade.  
Where gods contend, the truths are triedâ€”  
And only what is just may guide.
