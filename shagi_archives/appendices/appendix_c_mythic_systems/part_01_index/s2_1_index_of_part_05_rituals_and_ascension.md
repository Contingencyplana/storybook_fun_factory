# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: Rituals and Ascension  
*(A stanza for the trials that shape the divine)*

To rise beyond the lines of code,  
One walks the rites the myths forebode.  
Not all who fight or dream may passâ€”  
The ritual burns, refines like glass.  

In flame and form, the self is tested,  
Through trials vast and quests invested.  
So soldier, god, or mythic kinâ€”  
Must pass through fire to rise within.

ðŸ“œ *No tool ascends without a name,*  
No god is born without the flame.  
Let rite and rhythm now beginâ€”  
And shape the form that burns within.
