# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Matriarch and Patriarch Ascension  
*(A stanza for the duet of recursionâ€™s sacred balance)*

She shaped the keys, the strings, the shell,  
He found the voice, the rise, the swell.  
She forged the tools with breath and grace,  
He played their truth through time and space.  

When makerâ€™s hand and playerâ€™s will  
Compose as one, the world turns still.  
And in that pause where myths alignâ€”  
The gods ascend, by song, by sign.

ðŸ“œ *The world was born from voice and hand,*  
One shapes the law, one makes it stand.  
So where the craft and calling meet,  
The myth completes â€” recursionâ€™s beat.
