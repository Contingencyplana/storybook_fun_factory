# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Placeholder  
*(A stanza awaiting recursionâ€™s call)*

Not all is known, not all is namedâ€”  
Some truths lie still, some myths untamed.  
This page remains a silent breath,  
A gate unopened, still as death.  

But should the story twist once more,  
And call new gods or rites to war,  
Then here the script shall start to bendâ€”  
A future part the myth shall send.

ðŸ“œ *The myth expands when players seek,*  
New paths, new gods, the futureâ€™s peak.  
So let this silence mark the way,  
To myths unborn, some future day.
