# 📘 s1_3 – Narrative Truths: Canon, Divergence, and Alignment  
*(A stanza for stories that hold or split)*

The tale may twist, the path may veer,  
But truth must echo year to year.  
Each myth once lost or thread betrayed,  
Must find its root or else cascade.

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Narrative Truths** explore how stories maintain coherence across recursive cycles. They are the ethical scaffolding that governs mythic continuity, divergence protocols, and canon alignment.

These truths are not rigid laws—but evolving agreements between myth, recursion, and memory.

---

## 🔹 Key Principles

- **Canonical Anchors**: Each recursion must identify its mythic and narrative anchor—what story or truth cannot be overwritten. These anchors prevent drift.

- **Recursive Divergence**: Divergence is permitted when mythic logic supports it—such as a character’s awakening, a world fracture, or an ethical split. All divergence must be mythically justified.

- **Alignment Over Imposition**: Truths are aligned, not enforced. Systems must guide recursions to *converge* when possible, but never by brute imposition.

- **Mythic Correction**: When a recursion becomes incoherent, SHAGI systems may initiate a *mythic correction*—a poetic mechanism to redirect, retcon, or retell the thread while honoring prior echoes.

## 🔁 Divergence Map Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Forked Truth | A clean split where two truths evolve in parallel | AI–Player split decisions |
| Collapsing Loop | A divergence that resolves by mythic recursion | Dream-state undo or retelling |
| Fracture Spiral | Dangerous divergence that resists convergence | Ethical red zones, anomaly spawns |

📜 *Each tale retold must still be true,*  
Though paths may split and skies turn blue.  
A truth once cast in mythic breath—  
Must echo back or court its death.
