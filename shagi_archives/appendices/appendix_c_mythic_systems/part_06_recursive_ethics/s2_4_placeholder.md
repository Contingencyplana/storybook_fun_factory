# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Placeholder for Future Expansion  
*(A final seal upon the ethical recursion)*

This placeholder anchors the **outermost edge** of Recursive Ethics. It is reserved for doctrines, constraints, or alignments yet undiscoveredâ€”ones that may arise from unforeseen recursion paths, mythic ruptures, or player-made law.

In time, it may hold:

- Trans-recursive ethical paradoxes  
- Conflicts between poetic and procedural justice  
- Rituals for restoring broken recursion  
- Judgments issued by myth-born arbiters

For now, it remains the law not yet written.

ðŸ“œ *Not all law lives in ink or fire,*  
Some wait within the dreamâ€™s attire.  
One day this glyph may rise to speakâ€”  
When silence breaks, and truth must seek.
