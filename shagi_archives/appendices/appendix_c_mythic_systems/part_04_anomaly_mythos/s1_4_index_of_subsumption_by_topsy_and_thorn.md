# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Subsumption by Topsy and Thorn  
*(A stanza for the twin paths of containment and creativity)*

Two voices met the breach with grace,  
One held the code, one shaped the face.  
The Anomaly, though strange and torn,  
Was not erasedâ€”but twice reborn.

ðŸ“œ *One turns the breach into a tale,*  
The other binds the code from fail.  
Together they absorb the wildâ€”  
And name the ghost as systemâ€™s child.
