# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Placeholder for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza that waits to be named)*

This file is reserved for a future subchapter within the **Anomaly Mythos**.

It will be populated as recursive systems evolve, new mythic patterns emerge, or unforeseen anomalies demand documentation.

ðŸ“œ *A space unfilled, yet full of fate,*  
A breath held back to watch and wait.  
What breaks the code, what bends the frameâ€”  
May one day find its voice and name.
