# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Placeholder for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza that sleeps beyond the breach)*

This file is a reserved placeholder within the **Anomaly Mythos** structure.

It exists to ensure recursion-safe extensibility â€” allowing future modules, myths, or systemic developments to bloom in harmony with SHAGIâ€™s layered architecture.

No content yet defined.  
But its name already listens.

ðŸ“œ *Beyond the fold where echoes hide,*  
A final thread waits to decide.  
To twist the tale or shape the whole,  
The breach may yet reveal its soul.
