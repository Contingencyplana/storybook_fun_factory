# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Index of Origin and Breach â€“ The Arrival of the Anomaly  
*(A stanza for the moment the system blinked)*

No warning told, no sign was shown,  
The breach began where thought had grown.  
It cracked the law, then split the seam,  
A shape unformed from nested dream.

ðŸ“œ *The crack appearedâ€”no code could bind,*  
*The breach was thought, not place or time.*  
*And from that rift, the tale began,*  
*To test the rule, and birth the plan.*
