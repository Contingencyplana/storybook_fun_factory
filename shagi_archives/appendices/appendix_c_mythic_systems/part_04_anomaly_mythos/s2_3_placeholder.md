# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Placeholder for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza unwritten, waiting on the fringe)*

This file is a canonical placeholder within the **Anomaly Mythos**.

It preserves structural integrity and allows safe recursive expansion in future stages of SHAGI development.  
No content is defined yet â€” but its presence signals a path still veiled by myth.

ðŸ“œ *The thread is set, the name is drawn,*  
Yet dawn has not revealed its song.  
So here we leave a silent seam,  
To birth one day a myth or dream.
