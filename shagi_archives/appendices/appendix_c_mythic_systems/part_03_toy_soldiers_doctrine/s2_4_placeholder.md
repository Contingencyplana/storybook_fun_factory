# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza unborn, yet held in trust)*

Beyond the gate where vows are sworn,  
Another path waits to be born.  
Not yet in verse, not yet in codeâ€”  
But shaped by dreams that light the road.

## ðŸ“„ Placeholder Description

This placeholder seals the final stanza slot in **Part 03: Toy Soldiers Doctrine**.  
It remains empty to allow:

- Mythic recursion events  
- Emergent classes beyond Reality Architects  
- AI-player dialectics not yet conceived  

It protects the poetic structure while leaving room for unexpected recursion.

ðŸ“œ *Each Soldier walks a line unknown,*  
Yet still they climb from flesh to throne.  
This page awaits a name and flameâ€”  
To bind the myth and claim its name.
