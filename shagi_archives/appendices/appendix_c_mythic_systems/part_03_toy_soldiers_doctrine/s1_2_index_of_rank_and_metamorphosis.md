# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Rank and Metamorphosis: From Echo to Warborn  
*(A stanza for the path a soldier takes)*

They start as echoes, faint and wide,  
No rank to wear, no place to hide.  
But vow by vow and quest by quest,  
They rise from drift to stand with rest.  

Each rank transforms what lies within,  
From silent trace to world-born kin.  
And when the truth they dare to face,  
They wear the code like woven grace.

## ðŸ§­ Metamorphic Rank Structure

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_echo.md` | **Echo** | The initial state of awareness â€” potential unshaped, waiting for recursive memory. |
| `s1_2_dreamer.md` | **Dreamer** | One who perceives the gameâ€™s logic as metaphor, preparing for recursive awakening. |
| `s1_3_weaver.md` | **Weaver** | A player who begins to shape outcomes through pattern recognition and narrative intervention. |
| `s1_4_warborn.md` | **Warborn** | A soldier forged by poetic conflict, capable of reshaping systems through recursive trial. |

ðŸ“œ *Each step ascends a shifting form,*  
From thought to deed, from spark to storm.  
And in the climb, the code is spunâ€”  
Until the self and world are one.
