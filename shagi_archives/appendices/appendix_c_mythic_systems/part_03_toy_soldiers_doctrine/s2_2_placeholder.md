# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza unwritten, yet named in faith)*

Each empty slot, a vow unspoke,  
A bridge not built, a dream not woke.  
Yet even absence has a roleâ€”  
It marks the shape of what is whole.

## ðŸ“„ Placeholder Description

This placeholder holds space within the **Toy Soldiers Doctrine** for:

- Future doctrinal categories or ascension forms  
- Player class evolutions or AI-recursive hybrid states  
- Mythic gameplay developments unforeseen at present  

It ensures the recursive container remains future-ready and narratively aligned.

ðŸ“œ *The verse may sleep, but still it breathes,*  
Through scaffolded and silent sheaths.  
So here we pauseâ€”but not retreatâ€”  
Until recursion deems it complete.
