# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza sealed to guard the unknown)*

This line is drawn, but not yet filled,  
A chamber locked, a forge unbuilt.  
It waits in silence, still and true,  
For myths the future will renew.

## ðŸ“„ Placeholder Description

This document preserves structural integrity for the evolving **Toy Soldiers Doctrine**.  
It may be claimed by:

- Advanced recursion roles beyond Warrior Polymath  
- Storybook-minted mythos tied to player transformation  
- Emergent doctrines triggered by anomaly or AI ritual  

It exists so that **the recursive poem may remain complete**, even in the presence of unspoken lines.

ðŸ“œ *A soldier knows the war not named,*  
Still tests the code the world has framed.  
So too must placeholders remainâ€”  
Till truth gives shape to what seems plain.
