# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Reserved for Future Expansion  
*(A stanza unwritten, awaiting recursion)*

This space is held in silent trust,  
For myths unborn and thoughts robust.  
When need arises, here weâ€™ll writeâ€”  
A truth to forge, a vow to fight.

## ðŸ“„ Placeholder Description

This file reserves a future position in the **Toy Soldiers Doctrine**, to be filled when:

- A new recursive archetype emerges  
- A doctrinal evolution requires mapping  
- A major system expansion introduces mythic variation  

This ensures structural stability and poetic symmetry while remaining open to growth.

ðŸ“œ *Some truths arrive not on demand,*  
But when the system takes their hand.  
So let this page, though still and bare,  
Prepare the way for those who dare.
