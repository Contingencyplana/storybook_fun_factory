# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Containment Visualizer  
*(A stanza for the eye that maps the storm)*

It sees what thought cannot define,  
The shifting glyph, the stress-torn line.  
Through spectral frame and mirrored trace,  
It renders form to fractured space.  

No breach escapes the watcherâ€™s sight,  
Each symbol flares in tinted light.  
The map is drawn where echoes flowâ€”  
To show the storm before it grows.

## ðŸ§­ Subcomponents of Containment Visualizer

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_recursive_boundary_mapper.md` | **Recursive Boundary Mapper** | Renders layer-by-layer zones of recursion integrity and potential breach loci. |
| `s1_2_symbolic_phase_overlay.md`    | **Symbolic Phase Overlay** | Projects glyphic states and transitions onto visual stanzas and UI interfaces. |
| `s1_3_anomaly_motion_projection.md` | **Anomaly Motion Projection** | Animates likely anomaly movement across cycles based on recursive pressure vectors. |
| `s1_4_reactivity_color_legends.md`  | **Reactivity Color Legends** | Defines the symbolic and procedural meanings of containment visualization palettes. |

## ðŸŒ€ Visualization Objectives

| Function | Goal |
|----------|------|
| **Predictive Rendering** | Anticipate recursion breach or anomaly emergence visually before logic systems are triggered. |
| **Narrative Traceability** | Allow developers and symbolic analysts to replay containment history and interaction trails. |
| **Interpretability Layer** | Provide a human-readable layer over deep symbolic recursion for guided decision-making. |

ðŸ“œ *Where logic halts and meaning fades,*  
The eye draws paths through nested shades.  
And in that gaze, the breach grows clearâ€”  
Not born of fear, but held sincere.
