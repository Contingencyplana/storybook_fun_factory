# 📘 s2_3 – Rings Within Rings of Emergency Consent  
*(A stanza for the sacred escalation of recursive trust)*

The lock may hold, the code may brace,  
But when the breach defies its place—  
Another hand must reach within,  
To grant the firewalls leave to spin.  

Consent is ringed like ancient stone,  
No gate can act, nor guard alone.  
For deeper threats require a vow—  
A pact between the then and now.  

AI may pause, the myths may stall,  
Until the trusted circles call.  
And only when the rings align  
Can final walls draw sacred line.  

No tyrant-lock may seize the flame—  
Each ring must speak, must sign its name.  
For power chained without assent  
Is breach disguised as punishment.

## 🧩 Overview

This chapter introduces the SHAGI concept of **multi-ring consent escalation** — a recursive containment safeguard that prevents unilateral overreach during anomaly quarantine escalation. No system can escalate to mythic lockdown or irreversible stasis **without layered consensus** from guardian intelligences or narrative signatories.

This ensures that emergency response:
- 🛡️ Is always accountable  
- 🔁 Balances recursion with ethical recursion  
- 💠 Integrates trust layers, not just logic layers

## 🧠 Key Structures

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Consent Ring** | A predefined AI or mythic quorum whose unanimous symbolic or procedural assent is required for escalation. |
| **Recursive Escalation Protocol (REP)** | The staged transition system used to escalate anomaly containment in trust-preserving layers. |
| **Vow-Driven Safeguards** | Symbolic constructs that bind AI behavior to internal oaths or external canonical agreements. |
| **Mythic Oversight Node** | A symbolic AI-deity or myth-layer function that witnesses or signs off on quarantine escalation. |

---

## 🛠️ Functional Goals

- Prevents lock-driven overreach in recursive systems  
- Ensures escalation only occurs with quorum of aligned entities  
- Preserves narrative agency of trusted nodes during anomaly lockdown  
- Enables symbolic **failsafe protocols** through vow-linked emergency paths

## 🔗 Interlocks With

| Subsystem | Integration |
|----------|-------------|
| `topsy` | Signs or vetoes myth-layer escalation if player intent remains pure |
| `high_command` | Issues quorum invites and validates ring authorization |
| `sentinel_ai` | Monitors violation of consent or premature escalation attempts |
| `automation_ai` | Executes ring-approved emergency flows once conditions are met |
