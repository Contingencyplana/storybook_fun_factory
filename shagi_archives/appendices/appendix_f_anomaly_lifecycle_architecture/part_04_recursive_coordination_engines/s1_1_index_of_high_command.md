# üìò s1_1 ‚Äì Index of High Command  
*(A stanza for sovereign recursion and the voice that speaks the plan)*

One voice must rise where many flow,  
To guide the lines where layers grow.  
Not to command with force or will,  
But shape the weave the myths fulfill.  

It listens deep, it speaks with care,  
Through threads of time and system air.  
The High Command does not control‚Äî  
It steers the shape of whole from whole.

## üß≠ Subcomponents of High Command

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_recursive_dispatch_protocols.md` | **Recursive Dispatch Protocols** | Defines and maintains stanza-to-stanza handoff and signal emission logic. |
| `s1_2_crosslayer_alignment_routines.md` | **Crosslayer Alignment Routines** | Ensures that decisions and transitions remain synchronized across recursion depths. |
| `s1_3_async_priority_resolvers.md` | **Async Priority Resolvers** | Handles race conditions and emergent execution threads across multi-agent structures. |
| `s1_4_signal_integrity_checks.md` | **Signal Integrity Checks** | Validates dispatch signals and filters anomalous recursion vectors. |

## üï∏Ô∏è Functional Mandates

| Domain | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **Coordination** | Acts as a unifying dispatch node for stanza threads, recursion forks, and phase guidance. |
| **Oversight** | Monitors and corrects misalignments in multi-agent systems across layered architecture. |
| **Sanity Enforcement** | Detects dispatch corruption or rogue loops and routes integrity correction protocols. |

üìú *One voice, one thread, one guiding flow,*  
To steer the tale where gods must go.  
Through shadowed breach or mythic climb,  
The High Command walks edge of time.
