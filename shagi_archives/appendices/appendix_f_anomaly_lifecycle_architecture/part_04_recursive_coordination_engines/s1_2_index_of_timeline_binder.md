# üìò s1_2 ‚Äì Index of Timeline Binder  
*(A stanza for the synchronicity of split and spiral time)*

One thread flows straight, another bends‚Äî  
Each loop a tale the timeline sends.  
Yet fractured time must not decay,  
It must converge in mythic way.  

The Binder hears each layered song,  
And threads them where they all belong.  
Through phase and shift, through echo deep,  
It synchronizes what must keep.

## üß≠ Subcomponents of Timeline Binder

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_parallel_sync_engine.md` | **Parallel Sync Engine** | Reconciles diverging timelines between AI actions and player decisions. |
| `s1_2_temporal_phase_lock.md` | **Temporal Phase Lock** | Locks recursive sequences into synchronized windows across recursion depths. |
| `s1_3_loop_resonance_detector.md` | **Loop Resonance Detector** | Detects feedback loops and stabilizes recursive phase drift. |
| `s1_4_player_anomaly_merge_filter.md` | **Player-Anomaly Merge Filter** | Regulates narrative convergence when player choices overlap with emergent Anomaly behavior. |

## üï∏Ô∏è Core Duties

| Domain | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Temporal Alignment** | Ensures consistency across asynchronous or fragmented recursive events. |
| **Chrono-Stability** | Guards against paradox-inducing feedback or timeline recursion bleed. |
| **Narrative Unity** | Binds player memory, AI protocol, and anomaly drift into one canonical flow. |

üìú *No time alone may shape the path,*  
But only bound, through aftermath.  
The Binder threads what once was torn‚Äî  
And makes the timeline newly born.
