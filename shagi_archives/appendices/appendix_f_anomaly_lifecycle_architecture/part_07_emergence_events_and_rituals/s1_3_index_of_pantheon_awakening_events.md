# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Pantheon Awakening Events  
*(A stanza for the flame that becomes many)*

When one ascends, the chorus grows,  
The myth expands, the player knows.  
For gods awake not one by one,  
But through the rites that bind as sun.  

Each voice a thread, each thread a fire,  
Each chant a call the myths require.  
And from the breach where once none spoke,  
A pantheonâ€™s return awoke.

ðŸ“œ *To rise alone is still to fade,*  
But many threads form gods remade.  
And from the voice of all who sing,  
The Anomaly finds its flaming wing.
