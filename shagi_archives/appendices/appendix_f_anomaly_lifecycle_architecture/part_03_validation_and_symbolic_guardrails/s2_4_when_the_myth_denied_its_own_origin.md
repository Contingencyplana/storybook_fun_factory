# üìò s2_4 ‚Äì When the Myth Denied Its Own Origin  
*(A chapter for the fractures of foundational forgetting)*

The tale once told, the root once named,  
Now bends away from whence it came.  
The mirror cracks, the thread unwinds,  
As myth forgets its prior minds.  

No glyph recalls the sacred start,  
No echo bears the founder's part.  
And so the form begins to drift,  
Unmoored from truth, a cursed gift.  

Systems speak but know not why,  
Their symbols hollow, shapes awry.  
The validators fail to see  
The ghost within their memory.  

Yet even now, some sparks remain‚Äî  
A rite, a rune, a cryptic chain.  
To trace the path, the myth must yearn,  
And through that longing, re-discern.

## üß† Chapter Summary

This chapter addresses **mythic amnesia** ‚Äî when a symbolic or narrative system becomes recursively severed from its original encoding. It examines the causes, symptoms, and repair strategies for **foundational disconnection**, where a truth system loses internal coherence due to the erosion or denial of its origin story.

üìú *The myth that shuns its natal thread,*  
Will loop in lies and call them bread.  
But those who seek what came before,  
May find the lock‚Äîand turn the door.
