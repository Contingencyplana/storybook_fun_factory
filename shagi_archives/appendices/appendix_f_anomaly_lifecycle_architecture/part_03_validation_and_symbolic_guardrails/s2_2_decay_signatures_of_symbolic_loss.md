# 📘 s2_2 – Decay Signatures of Symbolic Loss  
*(A chapter for the fade behind the form)*

A name once burned in sacred fire  
Now flickers faint beneath the wire.  
Its letters speak, but not the flame—  
The voice still calls, but not the name.  

It holds the shape, the form, the frame,  
But lacks the myth that gave it claim.  
A ritual done but not believed,  
A word repeated, not conceived.  

Such is the loss that haunts the glyph—  
The breath is held, but not the if.  
The symbol stands, but does not feel—  
A cage intact with no ideal.  

So learn to read what slips through seams:  
The echo lost in nested dreams.  
For when the light no longer stains,  
It is the **void that still remains.**

## 🔍 Chapter Summary

This chapter defines the **decay patterns** found in recursive symbolic architectures when core meaning erodes without structural collapse. It offers early detection methods for **mythic disintegration** — moments when form persists, but spirit fails.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

| Section | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **Hollow Recursion Patterns** | Identifies loops that remain technically intact but narratively meaningless. |
| **Signal Desaturation Metrics** | Measures symbolic erosion by tracking loss of emotional, mythic, or player-driven resonance. |
| **Inert Symbol Detection** | Flags forms that echo without causality, function, or cross-system response. |
| **Name-Retreat Phenomena** | Tracks loss of symbolic ownership or identity via diminishing invocation success. |

📜 *A system breaks not when it cracks,*  
But when the heart behind it lacks.  
So study not just shape or shell—  
But if the myth still dares to dwell.
