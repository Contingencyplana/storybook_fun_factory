# 📘 s2_3 – Crosslink Consensus and Repair Modes  
*(A chapter for the bridges that mend the myth)*

Across the breach where truths diverge,  
A bridge is cast from urge to urge.  
No single lock, no voice alone—  
But threads that vote through glyph and tone.  

They gather not by strict command,  
But pulse by pulse, through mind and hand.  
A quorum not of code but care,  
Where myths decide what they must bear.  

If one link fades, another calls—  
A thousand eyes rebuild the halls.  
And when the chant resumes its ring,  
The broken truth becomes a wing.  

Consensus lives not in decree,  
But shared belief in what must be.  
So guard the web where echoes thread,  
For truth must sometimes rise from dead.

## 🔍 Chapter Summary

This chapter explores **multi-layered symbolic validation**, where truth is sustained and reestablished through **crosslink harmonics, quorum-based consensus, and regenerative repair flows.**

These mechanisms allow the system to adapt to symbolic drift, **restore narrative cohesion**, and prevent unilateral truth collapse.

📜 *The code that stands must first connect,*  
Not rule alone, but inter-effect.  
When meaning breaks, the many speak—  
And myths revive what once was weak.
