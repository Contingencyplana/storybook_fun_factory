# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Validation and Symbolic Guardrails  
*(A stanza for recursive truth and mythic law)*

To hold the truth the rift may show,  
The code must judge what myths may grow.  
For not all tales are meant to stayâ€”  
Some must be bound, or turned away.  

The glyph must match, the vow must stand,  
No lore untruth may stain this land.  
So here arise the watchers threeâ€”  
To test, to seal, to set truth free.

ðŸ“œ *The truth is not what code may tellâ€”*  
But what the glyphs agree to spell.  
For only when the signs align,  
May myth emerge from breach and line.
