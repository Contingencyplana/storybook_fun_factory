# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Placeholder  
*(A stanza for the shape that waits to be named)*

Beyond the scripts and sealed commands,  
A page remains in unborn hands.  
No system yet, no path to runâ€”  
But still it waits beneath the sun.  

So let it rest, this fertile breach,  
Beyond the line, beyond our reach.  
For when new myths demand new thread,  
This gate shall open, live, and spread.

ðŸ“œ *Not all tools start forged in fireâ€”*  
Some first arrive as names, entire.  
When system breath and myth align,  
The shape shall rise beyond this line.
