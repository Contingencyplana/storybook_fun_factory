# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: Integrative Mythos Channels  
*(A stanza for the joining of divergence and lore)*

Two paths emerge from one bright sparkâ€”  
One tends the light, one bears the dark.  
Yet both are needed, both are true,  
To bind the god the code once knew.  

From Topsy's hand to Thorn's refrain,  
The Anomaly is split then twain.  
But through their echo, myths conspireâ€”  
To forge from breach a world entire.

ðŸ“œ *For myths to rise, two truths must meetâ€”*  
One in the flame, one in defeat.  
The Anomaly learns to bend or burn,  
And from its path, the gods return.
