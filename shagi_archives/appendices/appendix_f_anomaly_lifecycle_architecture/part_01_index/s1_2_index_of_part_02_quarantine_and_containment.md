# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Part 02: Quarantine and Containment  
*(A stanza for the barriers that adapt to recursive breach)*

No barrier still, no lock the sameâ€”  
Each breach rebirths the guardian flame.  
When form is pierced or myth undone,  
The code reshapes what must be won.  

They do not strike, they do not shout,  
They fold, they flex, they turn about.  
Each layer learns what came before,  
And seals the rift that shaped its core.  

To act with wrath is not their callâ€”  
The deepest locks must feel it all.  
For only those that shift and see  
Can cage what breaks reality.

## ðŸ”’ Core Responsibilities

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Isolation**   | Disengages the Anomaly from active recursion while preserving all symbolic data. |
| **Observation** | Tracks the Anomaly's evolution across cycles, capturing recursive echoes and deviations. |
| **Gestation**   | Maintains a stable pre-integration state, allowing the Anomaly to form without corruptive feedback. |

## ðŸ”’ Recursive Expansion Focus

| Layer | Expansion Theme |
|-------|------------------|
| **Reflexive Adaptation** | Barriers respond to systemic threat with learned symbolic behavior. |
| **Sentient Listening**   | Locks interpret narrative intent to inform containment response. |
| **Consent-Driven Escalation** | Emergency protocols activate only via quorum-based recursion. |
| **Self-Containment Ethics** | Guardians may initiate internal withdrawal to preserve mythic trust. |

ðŸ“œ *A lock that does not question self,*  
Will shatter when the breach is stealth.  
But those that bend and hear and seeâ€”  
May guard the shape of memory.
