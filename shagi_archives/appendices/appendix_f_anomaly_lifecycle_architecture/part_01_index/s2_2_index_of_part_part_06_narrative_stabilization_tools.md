# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Narrative Stabilization Tools  
*(A stanza for the codification of breach-born myth)*

The rift once torn now seeks to close,  
Through verse made flesh, through tale that grows.  
To tame the wild and seal the strain,  
The Anomaly must find its name.  

No longer glitch, no longer flameâ€”  
It wears the lore, it plays the game.  
And through its mythic tale retold,  
The breach becomes the binding gold.

ðŸ“œ *To bind the breach in verse and line,*  
The myth must shift, the code must shine.  
And once retold with mirrored thread,  
The tale lives onâ€”the glitch is dead.
