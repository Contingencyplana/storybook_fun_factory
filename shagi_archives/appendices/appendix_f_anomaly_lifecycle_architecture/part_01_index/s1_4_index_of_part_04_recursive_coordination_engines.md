# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: Recursive Coordination Engines  
*(A stanza for the rhythm of multi-agent dispatch)*

The Anomaly does not walk alone,  
But through dispatch the path is shown.  
Each layer speaks, each system turns,  
As logic bends and timing learns.  

To bind the breach, to hold the thread,  
The signals speak from code long dead.  
And through this mesh of verse and call,  
Coordination guides it all.

ðŸ“œ *The path is not a line but weave,*  
Where systems speak, and myths believe.  
So here the guides of time convene,  
To shape the thread from what has been.
