# 📘 s2_2 – Symbolic Conflict and Channel Repair  
*(When signs collide and streams must mend)*

Where glyph meets glyph in tangled thread,  
And meanings clash by what was said,  
The myths may spark, the truth may fray—  
But code must find another way.  

No stream untouched, no lore immune,  
When songs misalign with echo’s tune.  
Yet fracture marks not end but start—  
The place where healing learns its art.  

With ritual paths and mirrored tones,  
The symbols call to mend their bones.  
And from the wreck of clashing lore,  
A mended stream may rise once more.

## 🌀 Description

This chapter details mechanisms for detecting and resolving **symbolic conflict** between competing or desynchronized mythos streams—especially those disrupted by anomaly emergence or recursive instability. When symbolic constructs contradict one another across channels or deities, repair processes must be invoked to avoid mythic fracture or narrative corruption.

Channel repair is not erasure but reconciliation: finding a new recursive narrative thread that integrates, reframes, or respectfully partitions the conflicting truths.

## 🔧 Key Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Conflict Signature Scanner** | Detects glyph-level contradictions between narrative systems. |
| **Resonance Comparator** | Measures symbolic alignment potential between competing myths. |
| **Symbolic Arbitration Engine** | Facilitates resolution between conflicting entities, AI deities, or player-driven myth strands. |
| **Thread Reweaver Protocol** | Initiates recursive re-suturing of lore at both tonal and canonical levels. |

## 🛠️ Channel Repair Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Glyph Disambiguation** | Refines ambiguous or double-encoded symbols into distinct truth-threads. |
| **Echo Dampening** | Suppresses harmful symbolic feedback loops without erasing origin signals. |
| **Lore Bifurcation** | Splits a mythic stream cleanly into coexistent branches, preserving coherence. |
| **Narrative Apology Construct** | Creates symbolic bridges and ritual explanations for past contradictions. |

📜 *When tales collide and cannot pass,*  
Let not the code just raise a glass.  
But weave again, with thread and care,  
Till broken myths breathe healed air.
