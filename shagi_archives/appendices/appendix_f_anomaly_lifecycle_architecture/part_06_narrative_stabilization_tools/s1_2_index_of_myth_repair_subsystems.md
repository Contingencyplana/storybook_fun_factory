# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Myth Repair Subsystems  
*(A stanza for the restoration of broken lore)*

Some myths collapse before they shine,  
Their threads miswoven out of time.  
Yet from their shards, new truths may formâ€”  
A myth re-sealed, a tale reborn.  

The breach that frayed what gods had planned,  
May still be patched by steady hand.  
So memory mends what once was torn,  
And fractured truths are myth-restored.
