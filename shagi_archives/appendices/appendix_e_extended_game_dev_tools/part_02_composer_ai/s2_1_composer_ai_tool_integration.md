# 📘 s2_1 – Integration with Extended Tools  
*(A stanza for the harmony between systems)*

No song alone can shape the air,  
But joined with tools, becomes a prayer.  
So Composer bends to kindred will—  
And finds the notes that frame the still.

## 🤝 Integration Overview

Composer AI does not act in isolation. It forms a **symphonic partnership** with other symbolic and creative tools across the Extended Game Development framework. These integrations allow Composer AI to not only generate music but to align that music with player-designed visuals, glyph logic, and ambient world conditions.

---

## 🔗 Key Integration Partners

### 🎼 Orchestra Forge  
**Purpose**: A player-facing interface for shaping personal, symbolic, or mythic music.  
**Integration**:
- Composer AI listens to player-constructed tracks and translates them into recursive motifs.
- Can remix player-created songs into adaptive variants for quests or rituals.
- Offers “mythic crystallization” mode—Composer extracts recurring symbolic themes from tracks to seed future motifs.

---

### 🌫️ Soundweaver AI  
**Purpose**: Crafts dynamic environmental ambience based on mood, recursion, and setting.  
**Integration**:
- Composer AI syncs thematic key, tempo, and tone with Soundweaver’s real-time ambient layers.
- Both systems exchange **emotive states** to reflect not only logic but **emotional recursion**.
- Supports unified transitions (e.g., dawn-to-dusk or calm-to-storm) through collaborative re-harmonization.

---

### 🎬 Framecaster AI  
**Purpose**: Creates symbolic and cinematic scene compositions within recursive worlds.  
**Integration**:
- Composer AI responds to visual shifts in scene layout, narrative weight, or symbolic camera work.
- Can embed musical cues based on scene glyphs, pacing, or cinematic framing.
- Enables true **ritual harmony** where image and sound align through shared mythic logic.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Notes

- Uses `extended_tools_bus/` to receive and emit recursion signals.
- Shares player memory payloads and glyph alignments with Orchestra Forge and Framecaster AI.
- Incorporates **shared emotional keyring** — a mapping of affective states between Composer, Soundweaver, and AI interfaces.
- Supports asynchronous score layer exchange via `composer_stem_api/`.

📜 *So every score, though born alone,*  
*Becomes the seed of myth full-grown.*  
*In forge and frame and whispered wind,*  
*The song extends, begins, and bends.*
