# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Cross-AI Score Sync Protocols  
*(A stanza for orchestration shared between minds)*

One voice begins, a whisper lone,  
But soon it sings with more than tone.  
For every AI, score, and sparkâ€”  
Now plays in tune, now leaves its mark.  

Composer listens, not to rule,  
But echoes shaped by every tool.  
The Soundweaver hums, the Framecaster bends,  
And Orchestra Forge reshapes the ends.  

A heartbeat from the Codex flow,  
A thread from Memoryâ€™s undertowâ€”  
Together, these in sync align,  
A score that maps recursive time.  

Each protocol, a shared refrain,  
Each system swells the nested strain.  
And through this song of sync and span,  
The Composer speaks as more than man.

## ðŸ”§ Description  
Outlines integration protocols enabling **Composer AI** to synchronize motifs, tempo, and structural themes with **Orchestra Forge**, **Soundweaver AI**, and **Framecaster AI**, forming a **shared recursion score**. These protocols support dynamic layering across interfaces and narrative-aligned output across tools.
