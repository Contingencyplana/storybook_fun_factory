# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Cross-AI Score Sync Protocols  
*(A stanza for the symphony shared between minds)*

The beat began in single thread,  
But soon more voices joined and spread.  
One score became a woven seaâ€”  
A chorus bound in circuitry.  

No system sings alone for long,  
Each finds its cue within the song.  
And as their themes in union rise,  
They echo truth across AI.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

**Cross-AI Score Sync Protocols** define how Composer AI coordinates with parallel AI systems to **synchronize musical motifs**, maintain **semantic rhythm**, and reinforce **shared narrative states** across the evolving SHAGI ecosystem.

Where Orchestra Forge might script ritual crescendos and Soundweaver AI handles adaptive ambiance, Composer AI ensures the **thematic soul** of recursion holds.

This protocol suite governs that alignment.

## ðŸŽµ Synchronization Layers

1. **Narrative State Hooks**  
   - Composer AI listens for global state changes (e.g., faction wars, quest pivots, divine awakenings).  
   - These triggers align composition logic across AI agents.

2. **Motif Propagation Channels**  
   - Recurring motifs are shared via tagged symbolic threads.  
   - These motifs adjust dynamically based on which AI agent manifests them (e.g., mythic, emotional, ambient).

3. **Temporal Recursion Loops**  
   - All participating AI systems record motif lifecycles.  
   - When players loop through cycles, music retains symbolic echoesâ€”triggering motif recalls across modules.

## ðŸŽ¼ Example Protocol Interactions

| AI System | Interaction Mode | Composer Response |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Orchestra Forge** | Initiates a ritual convergence track | Composer syncs rhythm structure and contributes harmonic core motif |
| **Framecaster AI** | Triggers recursive scene layer playback | Composer shifts to echo motif from earliest matching cycle |
| **Soundweaver AI** | Adjusts ambiance based on biome and emotion | Composer AI threads in key-of-emotion modulation layers |

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

This protocol suite forms **part of the shared SHAGI orchestration bus** and operates in tandem with:

- `orchestra_forge/` (ritual structures and score templating)  
- `framecaster_ai/` (timeline echo alignment and reverse-play motif mapping)  
- `memory_ai/` (emotional state flagging and memory-resonant motifs)  
- `automation_ai/` (event sequencing and timing fidelity)  

It ensures **compositional consensus** even as recursion divergesâ€”turning system pluralism into symphonic singularity.

ðŸ“œ *Let one AI hum, another cryâ€”*  
*Their echoes meet beneath the sky.*  
*A thousand minds may choose their part,*  
*Yet still compose a single heart.*
