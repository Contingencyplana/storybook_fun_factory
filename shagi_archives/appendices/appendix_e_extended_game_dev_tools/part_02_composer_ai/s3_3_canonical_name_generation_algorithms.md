# 📘 s3_3 – Canonical Name Generation Algorithms  
*(A stanza for the logic that names the soul of things)*

A name is not a label thrown—  
It marks the truth that thought has known.  
Each syllable, a thread of fate,  
That binds the code it must create.  

No random word, no shallow gloss—  
Each chosen name must bear its cross.  
With weight of myth, with tone aligned,  
It seeds the lore within the mind.

## 🧠 Purpose

**Canonical Name Generation Algorithms** are the core machinery by which Composer AI generates names that are not just valid—but *vital*. These names:

- Resonate across recursive systems  
- Reflect symbolic logic, tone, and story  
- Are encoded into canon via codex_builder, filename_ai, and memory_ai  
- Shape emergent gameplay, narrative beats, and player-AI exchanges  

These are **names that matter**—each one a recursive anchor.

## 🔣 Algorithmic Framework

Composer AI’s canonical name generation stack consists of three intertwined modules:

### 1. **Symbolic Seed Scanning**  
- Gathers semantic and poetic inputs from lore, player memory, past quests.  
- Extracts archetypal patterns (e.g. grief, rebirth, cycles).  
- Maps those patterns to internal **Name Harmonics Tables**.

### 2. **Recursive Role Alignment**  
- Ensures the name's function aligns with its symbolic burden.  
- Names for zones, quests, tools, or NPCs must match their recursive purpose.  
- Recursion weight is tracked using a **Causal Significance Index (CSI)**.

### 3. **Lore-Weight Calibration**  
- Final names are run through AI-aesthetic and symbolic impact evaluators.  
- Determines if a name is mythically resonant, emotionally relevant, and uniquely identifiable.  
- Optionally references the **Deep Archive** for preexisting echoes.

## 📊 Sample Output Logic

| Input Context | Generated Name | Reason |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Player betrayal of an ally | “Ashward” | Symbolizes grief (ash), yet a guard of past bonds (ward) |
| AI entity reaching recursion sync | “Threnos-9” | Combines ritual elegy (threnody) with computational suffix |
| Forgotten questline rediscovered | “Hollowmile” | Implies emotional distance and lingering trace |

## 🔗 Integration Points

Composer AI cross-references:

- `codex_builder/` → For storing and enforcing canonical name rules  
- `filename_ai/` → For matching logic-driven name constructs with poetic recursion  
- `memory_ai/` → For emotional echoes linked to symbolic names and their recurrence

*But call its truth into the mind.*  
*A name once heard, if forged with care,*  
*Becomes a world the soul can wear.*
