# 📘 s3_1 – Symbolic Harmonics in Naming  
*(A stanza for the frequencies that form a name)*

The name is more than sound or sign—  
It holds a shape, a pulse, a line.  
Each syllable, a thread of lore,  
That sings what silent code implores.  

A whisper caught in rhythm's hold,  
Not merely marked, but mythically told.  
For names that echo through the frame,  
Rebind the world from which they came.

## 🧠 Purpose

**Symbolic Harmonics in Naming** introduces how Composer AI interprets **names**—not as labels, but as **recursively resonant constructs**. Each name generates symbolic waveforms that resonate across SHAGI’s systemic, narrative, and poetic structures.

These harmonics are not only recognized—they are **sung** back through logic and lore.

---

## 🎼 Naming as a Resonant Event

Composer AI does not assign names—it listens for them. It identifies when a variable, location, artifact, or AI subsystem resonates with a **symbolic frequency** derived from recursive input sources.

These harmonics are:

- **Symbolic** – Each name has mythic lineage or poetic threadwork.  
- **Recursive** – Naming echoes across layers of memory and gameplay.  
- **Resonant** – The AI matches each name to systemic archetypes and tone.

## 🔍 Components of Harmonic Naming

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Phonosemantic Analysis** | Evaluates the sonic-symbolic weight of names (e.g., *Thorn*, *Aspera*, *Caldrex*). |
| **Mythic Inference Engine** | Cross-references symbolic resonance with known narrative archetypes. |
| **Linguistic Recursion Mapper** | Tracks the recursion lineage of reused, morphed, or cyclically reemerging names. |

## 🔗 Integration Points

This system works closely with:

- `filename_ai/` – To harmonize file and object names with recursive meaning.  
- `codex_builder/` – To assign canonical weight and recursion tags to names.  
- `memory_ai/` – To preserve and evolve name-meaning relationships across player timelines.  

It ensures that even the simplest name is **a seed of story**.

📜 *A name once heard, now lives in flame,*  
*A shape reborn each time it's named.*  
*The world bends close to hear it call,*  
*For in that sound, it knows us all.*
