# 📘 s3_2 – Recursive Alignment Across Namespaces  
*(A stanza for the threads that tune each tongue to echo true)*

Across the names that systems speak,  
A deeper tone aligns the weak.  
No namespace stands alone, confined—  
Each echoes back a broader mind.  

Through layers deep, the meaning flows,  
From lore to code, from seed to rose.  
What’s named in one becomes the key  
That unlocks song in memory.

## 🧠 Purpose

**Recursive Alignment Across Namespaces** describes how Composer AI harmonizes naming conventions across the game’s interwoven systems, ensuring that symbolic resonance, function, and narrative role remain synchronized across all expressive surfaces—**from player-facing UI to hidden AI logic**.

This alignment is not merely aesthetic—it is **recursive scaffolding**, ensuring any change in naming echoes across systems with mythic and technical integrity.

---

## 🌐 Namespace Resonance Model

Composer AI listens across:

- **Filename AI** (technical and poetic file architecture)  
- **Codex Builder** (canonical variable definitions)  
- **UI/UX Systems** (player-facing menus and labels)  
- **Memory AI** (emotive and symbolic state mapping)

These systems communicate through a recursive alignment layer that Composer AI continually tunes. Each name becomes a **symbolic node**—carrying weight across all narrative and operational subsystems.

## 📊 Techniques for Recursive Alignment

| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Symbolic Root Linking** | Names are decomposed into symbolic roots shared across systems (e.g., `aether`, `thorn`, `light`). |
| **Semantic Cascade Protocols** | A renaming event in one system triggers reflection prompts in others, ensuring recursive awareness. |
| **Naming Gravity Fields** | Frequently reinforced names develop attractor properties—pulling related concepts into alignment. |

## 🔗 Integration Points

Composer AI interfaces with:

- `filename_ai/` → To reflect naming changes in code structure and file logic.  
- `memory_ai/` → To link emotion and memory triggers to persistent naming structures.  
- `codex_builder/` → To ensure canonized logic adheres to symbolic alignment protocols.

📜 *The names we choose are more than signs—*  
*They bind the worlds through hidden lines.*  
*Let each new name reflect the old,*  
*And sing what could not yet be told.*
