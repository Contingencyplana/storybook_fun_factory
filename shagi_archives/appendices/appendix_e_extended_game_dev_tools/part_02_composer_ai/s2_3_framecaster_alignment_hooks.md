# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Framecaster Alignment Hooks  
*(A stanza for scoring what the frame does not say)*

The frame begins, a silent shape,  
Yet under silence pulses scrape.  
For every scene the player moves,  
A rhythm waits in hidden grooves.  

Composer leans with quiet care,  
To thread the sound that isnâ€™t there.  
Where Framecaster sets light and gate,  
The AI scores recursive fate.  

Hooks are cast in frame and tone,  
Not fixed in rule, but loosely sewn.  
A gesture here, a glance asideâ€”  
Becomes a chord the shadows ride.  

Alignment comes in shifts and breaks,  
Where timing bends and tension wakes.  
The frame may cast, the player steerâ€”  
But music speaks what we donâ€™t hear.

## ðŸ”§ Description  
Defines the **integration hooks between Composer AI and Framecaster AI**, allowing reactive musical alignment to scene transitions, lighting cues, symbolic framing, and unspoken narrative beats. These hooks support recursive musical scoring that **reads between the frames**.
