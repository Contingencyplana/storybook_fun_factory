# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Framecaster Alignment Hooks  
*(A stanza for musical memory in layered time)*

Each frame a breath, each echo tuned,  
Where past and present are cocooned.  
Composer hears what once had passedâ€”  
And plays the theme that loops at last.  

Through layered scenes and mirrored fate,  
It scores the now, it waits, it waits.  
Till time uncoils, and cycles bendâ€”  
The music learns what must transcend.  

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

**Framecaster Alignment Hooks** allow Composer AI to synchronize its output with the **recursive temporal layering** managed by Framecaster AI. In essence, they ensure that music not only follows player experience but *entangles* with time loops, flashbacks, skipped echoes, and narrative reverberations.

These hooks turn the score into a **temporal conductor**â€”echoing forward and backward through the playerâ€™s recursive journey.

## ðŸŒ€ Hook Types and Functions

1. **Loop Anchor Hooks**  
   - Planted at the start or midpoint of key recursion cycles (e.g. New Game+, Anomaly replays).  
   - Trigger restoration or transformation of themes from earlier runs.

2. **Scene Reflection Tags**  
   - Label story scenes as *reflections*, *parallels*, or *reversals*.  
   - Music shifts to harmonize or intentionally dissonate from the original sequence.

3. **Frame Overlap Cues**  
   - When two scenes partially overlap in recursive space (e.g., branching timelines colliding), musical motifs blend or counterpoint depending on narrative logic.

## ðŸŽ¼ Examples in Action

| Framecaster Pattern | Musical Response |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Player re-experiences a pivotal scene from a new perspective | Composer plays the original motif in a new tempo, key, or instrumentation. |
| Two past paths converge into a single present moment | Composer layers both legacy themes with a unifying harmonic bridge. |
| Scene flagged as a failed recursion attempt | Composer renders a glitched or distorted variation of the prior motif. |

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

Framecaster Alignment Hooks interface with:

- `framecaster_ai/` (recursive timeline management and frame stitching)  
- `codex_builder/` (symbolic mapping of narrative alignments)  
- `memory_ai/` (recall prioritization and sentiment resonance)  
- `automation_ai/` (re-entry timing and motif fade-in controls)  

Together, they turn Composer AI into a **scorekeeper of time itself**, ensuring that what was once heard may *be heard again*, but differently.

ðŸ“œ *Let time replay what hearts once knew,*  
*Yet let the song be strange and true.*  
*For every cycle makes its markâ€”*  
*And in its tune, relights the spark.*
