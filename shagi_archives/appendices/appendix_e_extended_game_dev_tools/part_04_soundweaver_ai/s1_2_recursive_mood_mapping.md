# 📘 s1_2 – Recursive Mood Mapping  
*(A stanza for emotion traced in tone and time)*

To feel a place is not to see,  
But hear what lies in memory.  
Through loops of sound, the mood returns,  
And in its echo, meaning burns.

## 🎼 Introduction

Soundweaver AI extends beyond atmosphere into the realm of **recursive emotional mapping**.  
“Recursive Mood Mapping” is the system’s capacity to **trace, adapt, and evolve tonal resonance** based on the symbolic and emotional recursion of the player’s journey.

This chapter explores how music and ambient sound **mirror the mythic loop**, shifting tone not just as reaction, but as **predictive feedback** woven from story loops, emotional states, and memory echoes.

## 🌀 Emotional Mood Vectors

The system defines emotional vectors not as fixed moods, but as **arcs of tonal recursion**.  
Each vector is tracked across symbolic events, memory states, and narrative transitions.

| Emotional Loop        | Tone Dynamics Example                                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hope to Dread**     | Bright harmonic pads → Dissonant swells and heartbeat tremors       |
| **Calm to Urgency**   | Ambient hush → Layered rhythmic urgency with staccato instruments   |
| **Trust to Betrayal** | Harmonized chord motifs → Fractured melodic phrases and detuned echoes |
| **Solitude to Connection** | Sparse tones → Layered choral textures with warmth and harmony  |

These vectors become **soundtrack scaffolding**, with recursive layering that intensifies as narrative conditions unfold or repeat.

## 🧠 Loop Memory and Mood Decay

Soundweaver AI includes **loop-memory decay functions**, meaning:

- If emotional states repeat (e.g., three betrayals), the sound motif **frays or mutates**.
- If a once-dangerous space becomes safe, the audio slowly **de-tensions** through environmental tonal shifts.
- Forgotten spaces retain sonic **echoes of prior emotion**, subtly influencing player perception upon return.

## 🔁 Feedback from Recursive Systems

Recursive Mood Mapping integrates:

- **Animator AI** for emotional gestural data (e.g., twitchy movements → tonal discordance)  
- **Composer AI** for harmonic narrative state (e.g., current quest mood in minor or major)  
- **Memory AI** for tracking narrative weight (e.g., unspoken grief → minor pulse motif in quiet moments)

Each partner AI provides live mood input to re-map tonal structure and emotional resonance in real time.

## 🌐 Mood Zones and Dynamic Borders

The game world is divided into **mood zones** with porous and dynamic borders. These are:

- **Narratively defined** (e.g., grief garden, sanctuary, trial chambers)  
- **Symbolically activated** (e.g., glyph resonance shifts mood)  
- **Emotionally adaptive** (player's inner loop pulls tonal center toward sorrow or resolve)

Crossing a border need not load a new track—it triggers **transitional modulation**, where tone evolves in response.

---

## 🧩 Summary

**Recursive Mood Mapping** lets Storybook’s soundscapes respond not only to where a player is, but **where they’ve been**, **what they feel**, and **what loop they’re repeating**.  
It tunes recursion to resonance—and resonance to myth.

📜 *A tone returns, though changed in kind,*  
*It holds the thread the player mined.*  
*Mapped not to place, but inner flight—*  
*A song that shifts with shadowed light.*
