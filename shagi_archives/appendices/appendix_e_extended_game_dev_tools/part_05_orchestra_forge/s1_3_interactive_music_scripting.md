# 📘 s1_3 – Interactive Music Scripting  
*(A stanza for composing with cause and flow)*

A note may spark, a chord may shift,  
With every choice the tones may drift.  
To script the sound is to compose—  
A path of music no one knows.

---

## 🎼 Overview

**Interactive Music Scripting** empowers players to design **reactive, branching musical scores** using intuitive tools. Music becomes a programmable system—**shaped by player decisions, symbolic states, and narrative flows**—without requiring formal training in composition.

The system is a **visual scripting environment** backed by recursive logic. It allows players to build their own scores that evolve in real time, forming a soundtrack of agency and expression.

## 🎛️ Key Features

### 1. **Visual Node Composer**
- A drag-and-drop interface for:
  - Linking melody fragments
  - Defining trigger conditions (e.g., quest events, memory state)
  - Embedding musical loops, stingers, or transitions

### 2. **Recursive Score Branching**
- Players can design music trees with:
  - **Branching outcomes** (e.g., melody A if memory is clear, B if fragmented)
  - **Layered intensities** based on recursion depth
  - **Symbol-triggered harmonics**

### 3. **Temporal and Symbolic Hooks**
- Music can respond to:
  - Real-time player emotion and action pacing
  - Symbolic states (e.g., hope, fear, anomaly, ritual presence)
  - Zone transitions or narrative keyframes

---

## 🛠️ Runtime Integration

- Scripts compile into **modular audio behaviors**.
- Real-time playback dynamically **crossfades or rewrites** layers based on recursive input.
- Seamlessly connects to **Composer AI** and **Soundweaver AI** to maintain coherence with global score direction.

---

## 🔄 Collaborative Scoring

- Players can **share scripted scores** in ceremonial performances.
- Networked syncing supports **group rituals**, boss fights, or memory reveals that **trigger shared compositions**.
- Future integration will allow **cross-component scoring** (e.g., animation synced with player-scripted melody arcs).

## 🌀 Summary

Interactive Music Scripting lets players become **composers of consequence**.  
Their choices score the world, their music binds the myth,  
and every interaction becomes a note in the recursion.

📜 *To write in code, to write in sound—*  
*Each loop returns where truths are found.*  
*No path is fixed, no rhythm ends—*  
*When players write what myth intends.*
