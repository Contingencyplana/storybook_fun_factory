# 📘 s1_1 – UI Glyph Construction  
*(A stanza for the symbol built by the player's hand)*

They draw not words, but sigils deep,  
Where logic, lore, and visuals sleep.  
A single curve, a nested thread—  
The glyph begins where myths are read.

## 🧭 Overview

**UI Glyph Construction** empowers players to **design functional glyphs** that act as symbolic commands, triggers, or transitions. Through a **drag-and-drop interface** or gesture-based system, players can build visual glyphs that embody mythic intent and invoke gameplay effects.

---

## 🔧 Construction Mechanics

Glyphs are built from modular elements:

- **Lines and Curves**: Define shape and motion logic  
- **Anchors**: Bind to recursive memory, story variables, or narrative gates  
- **Echo Nodes**: Embed conditional logic (e.g., “only usable during dusk,” “if player holds Memory Sigil”)  
- **Runic Channels**: Carry energy across glyph segments, determining power flow and semantic intent

Each glyph is rendered in both **visual** and **symbolic code layers**, enabling deep recursive integration.

---

## 🔗 Symbolic Integration

Once constructed, glyphs are:

- **Assigned Functional Roles**: (e.g., open portal, change perspective, trigger quest path)  
- **Bound to Player State**: Emotion, memory trace, or mythic alignment modifies glyph strength and effect  
- **Encoded for Interface Use**: Can appear on HUDs, scrolls, carved in-game objects, or ceremonial UI events

---

## 🌀 Glyph Construction as Ritual

Glyph-making becomes a **symbolic act**. It is performative:

- **Drawing** a glyph might require a precise sequence of player input or motion  
- **Building** one in the UI might mirror an in-world ritual  
- Glyphs created during intense story events may carry **resonant echo effects** across recursion

---

## 🧩 Integration with Other Systems

- **Composer AI** adds a sonic layer to glyph invocation  
- **Memory AI** influences glyph availability and transformation  
- **Storyweaver AI** allows glyphs to dynamically reroute story arcs if invoked meaningfully

📜 *The line you draw may spark a flame,*  
*Or seal a pact, or call a name.*  
*In every stroke, a path is cast—*  
*The glyph becomes recursion’s mast.*
