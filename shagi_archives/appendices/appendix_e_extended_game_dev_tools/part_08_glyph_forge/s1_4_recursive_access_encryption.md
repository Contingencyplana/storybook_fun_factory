# üìò s1_4 ‚Äì Recursive Access Encryption  
*(A stanza for the locks that guard the mythic gate)*

The gate must hold, the path be true‚Äî  
Not all may pass, not all may view.  
Each glyph is sealed with layered key,  
To guard the depth of what might be.

## üß† Overview

**Recursive Access Encryption** secures glyph-based interactions by requiring **multi-layered validation** before executing effects. This system protects game logic, narrative sanctity, and mythic progression from unearned access, accidental invocation, or symbolic corruption.

Glyphs thus become **encrypted recursion gates**‚Äîresponding only when meaning, context, and permission align.

## üîê Core Encryption Layers

1. **Symbolic Integrity Check**  
   - Verifies glyph was created according to known construction rules.
   - Ensures form matches canonical recursion grammar.

2. **Lore Binding Verification**  
   - Confirms semantic binding with accepted story threads or mythic anchors.
   - Protects against rogue or fabricated lore integrations.

3. **Player Role & State Authentication**  
   - Compares player‚Äôs role, rank, or memory fragments against access requirements.
   - Allows selective activation per questline, class, or recursion depth.

4. **Contextual Invocation Window**  
   - Limits usage to temporal, locational, or emotional zones.
   - Ensures glyphs are only live when symbolically appropriate.

## üõ°Ô∏è Recursive Lock Types

| Lock Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sigil Lock** | Activated only when a specific symbolic combination is displayed. |
| **Echo Lock** | Requires player to have experienced or remembered a certain mythic event. |
| **Role Lock** | Grants access to glyphs aligned with a specific narrative archetype. |
| **Phase Lock** | Tied to recursion phase, such as mythic dawn, anomaly dusk, or liminal flux. |

## üîÑ Dynamic Reactivity

Encrypted glyphs may:

- **Shift Lock Requirements** based on player behavior (e.g., gain access through growth).
- **Reject Invocation** with narrative feedback if validation fails.
- **Adapt Unlock Conditions** in parallel universes or post-quest scenarios.

This transforms glyph interaction into **narrative cryptography**‚Äîpuzzles of meaning rather than numbers.

---

## üß© System Integration

- **Sentinel AI** monitors for access violations or anomalies.
- **Memory AI** stores successful and failed invocation traces for narrative impact.
- **Composer AI** alters musical theming to hint at encryption presence or resolution.

üìú *Not all who knock shall break the seal‚Äî*  
*The glyph must know what‚Äôs fake or real.*  
*So dreams may pass, and rot may fail,*  
*And myths be guarded by the veil.*
