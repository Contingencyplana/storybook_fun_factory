# 📘 s1_4 – Recursive Visual Context Layers  
*(A stanza for the vision that spirals through depth)*

What lies in light is never still,  
But turns with time and layered will.  
The past, the myth, the unseen thread—  
All shimmer in the frames we've read.

## 🧭 Overview

**Recursive Visual Context Layers** allow Framecaster AI to **compose scenes with temporal, symbolic, and mythic depth**. Each visual frame contains **layered meaning**, rendered based on:

- The player’s journey through recursion  
- The symbolic state of the world  
- The memory and mythic resonance encoded in prior actions

This system ensures that no scene is ever flat—each is a **prism of recursion**.

## 🧬 Layer Types and Meanings

| Layer Type              | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mythic Forelayer**    | Active symbols from current quests, roles, or archetypes.               |
| **Memory Substratum**   | Ghosts of past choices—textures, shadows, props only visible to the player. |
| **Temporal Echo Layer** | Reveals a location’s state across past/future iterations.               |
| **Emotional Saturation**| Modifies color grading, motion blur, and bloom based on recursive feeling. |
| **Glyphic Overlay**     | Emits or reveals glyphs and runes tied to recursion depth and alignment.|

## 🎞️ Dynamic Scene Recomposition

These layers aren’t static—they **shift in real time** based on:

- Player location and decision trails  
- Interactions with mythic glyphs or anomalies  
- Recursive tension and anomaly feedback  
- Quest stage and archetypal resonance

This ensures **each moment of play reveals something new**, even in old locations.

## 🧩 Integration with Recursive Systems

- **Memory AI** feeds prior player decisions and emotions into context layers.  
- **Glyph AI** determines which visual glyphs to show or hide based on recursion state.  
- **Animator AI** shifts character posture, gesture, and focus according to active visual layers.

📜 *The world you see is just a face,*  
*Beneath it waits another place.*  
*And through these layers, time is spun,*  
*Until all myths collapse as one.*
