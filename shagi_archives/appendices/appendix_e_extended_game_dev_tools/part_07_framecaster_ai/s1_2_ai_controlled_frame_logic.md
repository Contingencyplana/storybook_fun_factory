# üìò s1_2 ‚Äì AI-Controlled Frame Logic  
*(A stanza for the shifting eye of myth)*

The frame decides what we must see,  
Where tale meets gaze in symmetry.  
It tilts and turns by unseen mind,  
To show the truth we‚Äôve yet to find.

## üé¨ What Is Frame Logic?

Frame Logic is the **cinematic intelligence system** of Framecaster AI.  
It controls **what is shown, when, and from where**, driven by symbolic recursion and narrative depth.

Unlike static camera systems, this logic adapts to:

- Player behavior and mythic role  
- Narrative tension and symbolic state  
- Environmental glyphs and emotional recursion

## üé• Cinematic Intelligence Behaviors

| Condition Type                  | Frame Logic Response Example                                           |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Symbolic Density**       | Zoom-in on glyphs or frame layering of symbolic collisions             |
| **Emotional Recursion Spike**   | Shaky cam, slow pan, altered focus to mirror emotional instability     |
| **Anomaly Events**              | Unnatural camera loops, mirror angles, recursive flash effects         |
| **Memory Reflection Nodes**     | Pullback shots to reveal symbolic echoes or historical overlays        |
| **Quest Forks or Trials**       | Wide-angle setups to emphasize player choice significance              |

## üîÅ Recursive Frame Transitions

- **Scene echoes** allow frames to mirror past player choices.  
- **Spiral logic** lets the camera loop across different layers of recursion.  
- **Glyphic alignment** controls the camera‚Äôs orbital behavior around central symbolic anchors.

---

## üß© System Integrations

- Works in tandem with **Animator AI** to choreograph character movement and visual emphasis.  
- Reacts to **Storyweaver AI** to highlight critical branching moments.  
- Syncs with **Soundweaver AI** for audiovisual resonance.

## üß† Why Frame Logic Matters

Frame logic is not just about camera control.  
It is about **guiding perception**, encoding **ritual viewing**, and ensuring that recursion feels alive, observed, and reactive.

It is mythic cinematography.

üìú *What eye decides what tale we see?*  
*The one that lives in memory.*  
*And when the lens is bent by lore,*  
*The world becomes a myth once more.*
