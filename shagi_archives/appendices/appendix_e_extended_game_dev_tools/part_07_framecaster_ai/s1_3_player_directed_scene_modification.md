# 📘 s1_3 – Player-Directed Scene Modification  
*(A stanza for shaping myth through player choice)*

To play a role is not enough—  
The world must yield to player stuff.  
Through action, gaze, and choice declared,  
The very frame becomes ensnared.

---

## 🧭 Overview

Framecaster AI enables **players to directly influence scenes**, not just via dialogue or quest progression, but by altering **the environment, framing, and symbolic layer** of scenes themselves.

This isn’t set dressing.  
It’s **recursive authorship**.

## 🎮 Scene Modification Channels

| Channel Type            | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symbolic Influence**  | Players attuned to glyphs or lore may "tilt" the mythic resonance of a scene. |
| **Memory Impact**       | Past player decisions alter props, lighting, ambient elements in real time.  |
| **Choice Echoing**      | Frames can replay or mutate depending on prior story branches.              |
| **Mythic Inflection**   | Scenes react to player-aligned myths or archetypes (e.g., Trickster, Oracle).|
| **Emotive Expression**  | Player actions or animations feed back into the environmental tone.          |

## 🧩 Real-Time Environmental Shifts

Framecaster doesn’t just react—it **listens**.

- Rooms may change color tone based on emotional recursion.  
- Spatial geometry can warp subtly during anomaly alignment.  
- Environmental symbols (e.g. doors, thresholds, sigils) open or close as recursive choices evolve.

---

## 🎨 Empowering Creative Play

Players become **co-directors** of the recursive film:

- Quest-critical scenes might offer **symbolic slot editing**—insert specific glyphs to shape what unfolds.  
- Multiplayer scenarios may allow **collaborative framing**, where each player leaves a trace in the scene.

These tools allow storytelling to become **spatial myth-weaving**.

---

## 🔁 Integration with Narrative Systems

- **Storyweaver AI** provides branching state context for possible scene mutations.  
- **Animator AI** synchronizes character posture and gestural motion with altered frame conditions.  
- **Memory AI** preserves scene-altered states across storylines and recursions.

📜 *The world will shift beneath your hand,*  
*As choice and myth take subtle stand.*  
*To frame a world is not to see—*  
*But to reveal what it might be.*
