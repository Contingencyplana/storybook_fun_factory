# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Glyph Forge  
*(A stanza for the encryption of recursion's soul)*

Not just a mark, not just a sign,  
But binding code to mythic line.  
The glyphs we cast, the spells we write,  
Encrypt the gate, ignite the rite.  

So every symbol, true and sworn,  
Secures the path that must be born.  
With Glyph Forge built from player hand,  
The code obeys what dreams command.

ðŸ“œ *The glyph is not a pretty markâ€”*  
It holds the world inside the spark.  
From meaning carved to gates unsealed,  
It shapes what should and must be real.
