# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Animator AI  
*(A stanza for the motion behind the myth)*

To move is more than limbs in spaceâ€”  
It is the echo of a place.  
A gesture drawn from deep within,  
Where code and story twist and spin.  

This tool gives shape to mythic flow,  
Where every motion helps us knowâ€”  
That in the frame, the truth is played,  
And dreams in motion are relayed.

ðŸ“œ *To animate is not to actâ€”*  
But to reveal what stories lacked.  
In frame and pose, the myth extends,  
And truth in movement never ends.
