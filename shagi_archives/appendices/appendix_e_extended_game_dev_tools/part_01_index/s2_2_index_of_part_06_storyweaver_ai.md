# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Storyweaver AI  
*(A stanza for the architect of branching myths)*

No code is needed, just the threadâ€”  
Of tale and choice where players tread.  
The weaver speaks in blocks and flow,  
To shape the paths that stories go.  

From quest to trial, from line to gate,  
It maps the shape of player fate.  
This interface is dream made realâ€”  
A lattice born of myth and zeal.

The Storyweaver builds the stream.
