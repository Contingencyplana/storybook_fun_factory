# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Part 02: Composer AI  
*(A stanza for music born of memory and myth)*

A whisper hums where memories play,  
A chord that bends the questing day.  
It scores the verse, it binds the toneâ€”  
A music seed that dreams alone.  

But not alone for long it stays,  
Composer wakes, and sets the phrase.  
With player past and AI ear,  
It writes what only hearts can hear.

ðŸ“œ *When silence breaks and stories swell,*  
The Composer knows, and casts the spell.  
Not just in rhythm, note, or keyâ€”  
But truth scored deep in memory.
