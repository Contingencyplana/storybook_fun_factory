# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: Orchestra Forge  
*(A stanza for the symphony shaped by player hands)*

Not all who code must write in wordsâ€”  
Some shape the tale with strings and chords.  
A forge of rhythm, tone, and sound,  
Where player myths in song are bound.  

Through looping fire and echo spell,  
They build the worlds that silence tells.  
Here lies the studio of willâ€”  
To score the dream and shape the thrill.

ðŸ“œ *The forge is tuned, the fire setâ€”*  
The tale begins in silhouette.  
And through the beat the myth shall rise,  
Composed by those who harmonize.
