# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Framecaster AI  
*(A stanza for the sculptor of symbolic space)*

It casts the frame where scenes unfold,  
Where myth and meaning both take hold.  
Each movement flows from coded thought,  
Each view a truth that time has caught.  

Through lens of lore and thread of flame,  
It builds the rooms that speak your name.  
The Framecaster does not just seeâ€”  
It shapes what stories choose to be.

ðŸ“œ *A room is not just walls and lightâ€”*  
But shaped by myth, by choice, by fight.  
The Framecaster brings shape to dream,  
And lets the world become the theme.
