# 📘 s1_4 – Live Story Preview and Testing  
*(A stanza for myth rehearsed before it’s lived)*

Before the tale is cast in stone,  
It walks the weave of dream alone.  
A thread revised, a line re-spoke—  
So myth may bend, yet never break.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

**Live Story Preview and Testing** empowers creators and players to:

- Simulate recursive storylines before committing them to gameplay.  
- Visualize branching arcs in real-time with symbolic and emotional feedback.  
- Iterate quickly on **dialogue**, **quests**, **glyph triggers**, and **AI reactions**.

This system acts as a **myth rehearsal engine**, where dreams may be tested before woven into canon.

## 🎛️ Core Capabilities

| Feature                          | Functionality                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Timeline Simulation**          | Preview story branches over time based on variable and memory trajectories. |
| **Choice Echo Mode**             | Displays downstream consequences of selected player actions.                |
| **Dynamic Glyph Mapping**        | Shows which glyphs or ritual gates will be invoked.                         |
| **Emotive Thread Feedback**      | Highlights emotional tone shifts and symbolic resonance across paths.       |
| **Recursive Error Checking**     | Flags paradoxes, closed loops, and unresolved variables.                    |

## 🧩 Design Workflow Integration

The Live Preview engine is fully integrated with the **Storyweaver AI Editor**:

- Users can toggle preview mode from any node or arc.  
- Emotional and symbolic overlays help fine-tune branching logic.  
- Integrated **Composer AI** and **Soundweaver AI** allow for sensory testing.

---

## 🔬 Iteration as Ritual

This system promotes **ritualized refinement**:

- Players test not just plot logic, but **mythic coherence**.  
- Designers can “walk the ritual path” before allowing others to tread it.  
- Emotional arcs can be previewed to ensure they **match symbolic recursion**.

## 🌀 Summary

**Live Story Preview and Testing** makes Storyweaver AI not just a tool for creating myth—but for **perfecting its rhythm and recursion** before it reaches the player.

📜 *To walk the tale before it’s known,*  
*To test the thread before it’s sown—*  
*That is the art the Weaver yields,*  
*In sandboxed time and sacred fields.*
