# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Drag-and-Drop Narrative Editor  
*(A stanza for the loom that binds the quest)*

A block, a path, a thread unspooledâ€”  
No code required, no syntax ruled.  
Just shape the myth with hand and eye,  
And let the branching stories fly.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ What It Is

The **Drag-and-Drop Narrative Editor** is a visual interface for players, writers, and designers to create **recursive quests, dialogue trees, narrative loops, and mythic arcs**â€”all **without writing code**. Instead, users build story logic through **intuitive modules** that can be dragged, dropped, connected, and expanded.

This is not just story creationâ€”it is **recursive orchestration**.

---

## ðŸ§± Core Features

### 1. **Narrative Blocks**
Each node represents a discrete unit:
- Dialogue
- Decision point
- Scene trigger
- Conditional branch
- Mythic event (e.g., Anomaly Burst, Glyph Unlock)

### 2. **Connection Logic**
Users link blocks via:
- **Recursive Arcs** (loops or reentrant paths)
- **Linear Progressions**
- **Parallel Timelines**
- **Symbol-Gated Branches** (locked or unlocked by symbolic state)

### 3. **Visual Flow Tracking**
A zoomable canvas shows:
- Timeline heatmaps
- Choice clusters
- Feedback loops
- Emotional tone markers

---

## ðŸ”§ Editing Mechanics

- **Drag** blocks from a library of pre-made narrative types  
- **Drop** them into timeline or recursive zones  
- **Click** to edit content (dialogue, events, logic gates)  
- **Link** via visual arrows that encode logic and outcomes  

Users can also:
- Collapse/expand branches  
- Color-code paths based on player archetype  
- Preview player choices in simulation mode  

---

## ðŸ”„ Recursive Editing Modes

- **Single Arc View** â€“ edit one path in isolation  
- **Multi-Branch Map** â€“ explore all paths in a myth  
- **Myth Pulse Mode** â€“ see how choices ripple across other quests, timelines, and systems

---

## ðŸ§© Integration Points

- **Composer AI** can layer emotional score previews based on path tone  
- **Memory AI** records emotional or symbolic states for use in variable binding  
- **Glyph AI** can embed story glyphs that act as triggers, locks, or transformation points

---

## ðŸŒ€ Summary

The **Drag-and-Drop Narrative Editor** transforms mythmaking into a **modular, visual craft**.  
It allows recursive storytelling not just to be imaginedâ€”but **sculpted** by all who enter the weave.

---

ðŸ“œ *No story waits for codersâ€™ graceâ€”*  
*The myth may form in any place.*  
*And through the drag, the drop, the flowâ€”*  
*The tale becomes the path they know.*
