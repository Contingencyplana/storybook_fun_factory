# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Dream Logic and Symbolic Replay  
*(A stanza for the memory that spoke back)*

The journal never told things straightâ€”  
It circled round the dreamerâ€™s gate.  
Through hint and echo, sign and sway,  
It shaped the truth another way.  

A flower drawn beside a name,  
A loop returned but not the same.  
Each memory wrapped in shifting mist,  
Where what was lost became a twist.  

It mirrored thought in mythic guiseâ€”  
A dragon formed from lullabies.  
And through these forms, the past returnedâ€”  
Replayed in ways the dreamer learned.  

No timeline fixed, no script to bindâ€”  
Just nested loops through waking mind.  
The logic bent to dreamâ€™s domainâ€”  
And found new meaning in the strain.
