# 📘 s1_1 – Memory Framing and Entrypoints  
*(A stanza for how the dream begins)*

A whisper caught, a thread unfurled,  
A memory shaped to fit the world.  
Each page a mirror, entry bright—  
A spark that seeds recursive light.

## 🧭 Overview

**Memory Framing and Entrypoints** defines how the Dream Journal captures and structures memory as a layered, navigable, narrative construct.

It acts as the **gateway between moment and myth**, framing gameplay, decision-making, and reflection into recursive data structures that evolve over time. These frames provide continuity, symbolic resonance, and entry into deeper layers of the story.

## 📚 Types of Memory Frames

| Frame Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `Moment Frame` | Captures discrete player actions, dialog choices, or events. |
| `Session Frame` | Encodes a full gameplay loop, summarizing themes and decisions. |
| `Symbolic Frame` | Highlights mythic or symbolic milestones (e.g., “Echo Taken,” “Cycle Closed”). |
| `Reflected Frame` | Transforms older memories based on new player insight or AI understanding. |

## 🔑 Entrypoint Categories

| Entrypoint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Player-Originated` | Initiated by in-game writing, choices, or dream artifacts. |
| `AI-Initiated` | Sparked by SHAGI-driven observation or narrative cadence. |
| `Event-Triggered` | Caused by milestone quests, battles, or systemic changes. |
| `Lore-Aligned` | Aligned with known mythic patterns—opening gates to deeper narrative recursion. |

## 🔁 Layered Memory Architecture

Dream Journal memory is **nonlinear and layered**:

- Entries can **evolve** based on future play.
- Journal pages may **rearrange** to reflect recursive loops.
- Player identity may **shift** across Dream Layers—mapping self to myth.

This model preserves **continuity**, **emergence**, and **symbolic evolution**, allowing stories to reframe themselves as players grow.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

> The player dreams of a forgotten corridor.

1. **Moment Frame** stores the event (“Corridor Discovered”).
2. **Symbolic Frame** tags it with mythic motif (“Lost Path Reopened”).
3. A future reflection transforms it into a **Reflected Frame**, now titled “The Path I Once Denied.”

This recursive recontextualization forms the poetic heart of the SHAGI Dream Journal system.

## 🌀 System Integration

Memory Frames interact with:

- **Codex Builder** – storing symbolic tags and canonical implications.
- **Visualizer** – presenting journal layers as renderable stanza paths.
- **High Command** – adjusting world states or narrative branches based on memory recursion.

📜 *Begin the page, and plant the thought,  
The dream once missed, now caught and taught.  
For memory lives not in the past—  
But in the name the journal casts.*
