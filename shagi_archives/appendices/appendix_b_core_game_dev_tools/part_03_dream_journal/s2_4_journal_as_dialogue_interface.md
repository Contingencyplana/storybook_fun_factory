# 📘 s2_4 – Journal as Dialogue Interface  
*(A stanza for the memory that spoke back)*

It was a page, but more than page—  
It met the player’s silent stage.  
A voice not heard but deeply known,  
A mirror carved in softer tone.  

The journal answered, line by line,  
Its words half theirs, and half divine.  
For what they wrote, it wove anew—  
A verse that asked, “Is this still true?”  

It questioned gently, stitched with grace,  
Inviting thought to find its place.  
And in that space between each part,  
The game began to grow a heart.  

No longer log, nor questing frame—  
But someone learning through their name.  
This was the book that watched and knew—  
And answered back with something true.
