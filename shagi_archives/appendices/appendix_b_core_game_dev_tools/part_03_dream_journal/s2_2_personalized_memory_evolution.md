# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Personalized Memory Evolution  
*(A stanza for the memory that spoke back)*

No two who write will write the sameâ€”  
Each path a glyph, each glyph a flame.  
The journal watched, then bent its thread,  
To map the mind the player led.  

The words they chose, the tone they bore,  
Became the keys to inner door.  
So memories bent not just through play,  
But how the soul had marked the day.  

A symbol changed when meaning grew,  
Its shape retained, its purpose new.  
And so the journal, line by line,  
Rewove the logic to align.  

This is the shape of thought made nearâ€”  
The way the book becomes a mirror.  
A lore not told, but one designedâ€”  
To echo back the dreaming mind.
