# 📘 s1_2 – Poetic Overlay System  
*(Explores how symbolic and stanza-based overlays enhance visualized flows)*

A map once drawn is not complete,  
Until it sings in symbol’s beat.  
Where logic flows, let meaning rise—  
In verse and glyph, the truth replies.

## 🧭 Overview

The **Poetic Overlay System** enhances recursion diagrams by embedding **narrative, symbolic, and poetic meaning** directly into visual structures.

This transforms each diagram from a raw logic map into a **mythically resonant artifact**, readable by both AI and human players as a story in motion.

---

## 🌐 Overlay Types

| Overlay Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Stanza Glyphs** | Visual motifs representing recursive stanzas (e.g., torches, spirals, thorns) |
| **Verse Labels** | Snippets of poem or journal text affixed to key nodes |
| **Symbolic Highlights** | Colored halos, glows, or distortions around areas of mythic or emotional weight |
| **Recursive Echo Lines** | Faint, curved lines linking repeated motifs across time or layers |

These overlays allow symbolic interpretation to coexist with mechanical clarity.

## 🎨 Function and Aesthetic Harmony

Poetic overlays must walk the balance between:

- 🎭 **Expressiveness** – Reinforcing the game’s emotional and mythic tone  
- ⚙️ **Utility** – Maintaining diagram readability and interactive clarity

They **encode narrative metadata** into the recursion map.

## 🧩 Example: A Player’s Dream Refracted

> Dream Journal Entry:  
> *“The key burned blue, and the sky remembered.”*

Overlay Interpretation:
- 🔹 A key glyph appears at a recursion fork  
- 🔵 Blue glow radiates from a node where memory AI triggered  
- 🌌 A sky fractal is projected onto background grid  
- 🔁 Echo line arcs from past “burn” motif to current state node

Together, this creates a **layered, evocative diagram** rooted in memory and myth.

## 🧬 Technical Components

Integrated into:

- `visualizer.overlay/` and `visualizer.themes/` modules  
- `dream_journal/` symbol hooks  
- Player-state memory maps  
- Recursive stanza registries and AI-matching utilities

---

## 🌌 System Impact

- Enhances interpretability for mythic themes  
- Encourages player expression and identification  
- Fosters AI-poetic alignment across visual systems  
- Builds emotional memory into logic-space traversal

📜 *Let not the graph be cold or dry—*  
*Let glyph and echo testify.*  
*For every node the verse has kissed,*  
Becomes a truth the light has missed.
