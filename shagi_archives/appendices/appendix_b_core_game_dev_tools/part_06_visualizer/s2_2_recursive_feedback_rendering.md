# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Recursive Feedback Rendering  
*(A stanza for the graph that dreams in shape and line)*

A thought once cast returns once moreâ€”  
It loops, it learns, it charts the core.  
Each playerâ€™s act, each AI guess,  
Becomes a shape in soft regress.  

A branching arc, a circling thread,  
Where meaning echoes what was said.  
The graph responds, alive with change,  
As thought and motion rearrange.  

Reflected back in colored stream,  
The map now pulses like a dream.  
A logic-beacon, tuned to toneâ€”  
That tells the system what itâ€™s shown.  

Here feedback lives in form and flowâ€”  
Not as report, but tale we know.  
It renders not what was, but mightâ€”  
A lantern held in player light.
