# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Visual Poetics and Graphs  
*(A stanza for the graph that dreams in shape and line)*

Not lines of code, but lines that feelâ€”  
A spiral thought, a turning wheel.  
The logic flows through arc and thread,  
Where shapes recall what once was said.  

Each stanza drawn in node and path,  
A mirrored glyph, a plotted math.  
Yet more than data here is shownâ€”  
The soul of logic, softly known.  

To see the thought is to believe  
That meaning moves where lines may weave.  
And from these maps, a tale is castâ€”  
A story traced from future, past.  

The graph becomes the verse made clearâ€”  
A shape that speaks, a thought sincere.  
So logic lives beyond the codeâ€”  
In rhythm, light, and glyph bestowed.
