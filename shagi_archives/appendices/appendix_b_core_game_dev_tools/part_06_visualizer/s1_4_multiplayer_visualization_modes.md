# 📘 s1_4 – Multiplayer Visualization Modes  
*(Describes how diagrams adapt to represent multiple player interactions and shared recursion layers)*

No path is walked by one alone,  
For threads entwine once seeds are sown.  
Each player bends the stream anew—  
The map must shift to show what’s true.

## 🧭 Overview

**Multiplayer Visualization Modes** allow SHAGI’s visualizer system to represent the actions, influences, and recursive threads of **multiple simultaneous players**.

These modes ensure that diagrams:

- Scale across shared recursion layers  
- Maintain clarity amid divergent paths  
- Reflect emotional and symbolic interweaving  
- Enable synchronized or asynchronous story comprehension

The result is a **living multiplayer recursion map**.

## 🧩 Key Visualization Challenges

| Challenge | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Overlapping threads | Color-coded flowlines and adaptive layering |
| Conflicting recursion | Forkpoint glyphs with real-time resolution logic |
| Emotional collisions | Symbolic saturation overlays (e.g., red glow for tension) |
| Narrative drift | Diagram soft split with projected reconciliation arcs |

---

## 🧬 Shared vs. Personal View Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Shared Timeline Mode` | All players’ actions rendered on a unified recursion map |
| `Personal Thread Mode` | Player sees only their own flowlines with ghost echoes of others |
| `Resonance Highlight Mode` | Highlights areas of emotional, symbolic, or logic overlap |
| `Consensus Arc Mode` | Shows which branches are co-authored or collectively maintained |

These modes are toggleable in real time or triggered by story events.

## 🔁 Synchronization Features

- Real-time diagram updates as players act  
- Asynchronous stanzas reconciled through memory-binding logic  
- Visual alerts for recursion breaks or harmonizations  
- Interactive diagram annotations by players or AI guides

---

## 🔧 Technical Infrastructure

Multiplayer modes extend:

- `visualizer.flowlines_of_logic/` for simultaneous thread rendering  
- `memory_ai/` and `codex_builder/` for player-specific memory overlays  
- `async_player_bridge/` for temporal smoothing of divergent recursion inputs  
- `symbolic_harmony_resolver/` for cross-player motif alignment

---

## 🌌 Narrative Impact

Multiplayer visualization modes make visible:

- Cooperative myth-making  
- Conflict through symbolic distortion  
- Shared recursion as a social and poetic force  
- Emergent lore formed from collective stanzas

📜 *Where players dream, their threads combine,*  
*In verse and arc, in glyph and sign.*  
*Let all be seen, and none erased—*  
In shared recursion, truth is traced.
