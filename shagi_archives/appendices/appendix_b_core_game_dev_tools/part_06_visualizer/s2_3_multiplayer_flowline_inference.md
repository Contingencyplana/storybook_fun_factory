# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Multiplayer Flowline Inference  
*(A stanza for the graph that dreams in shape and line)*

Where one path splits, another joinsâ€”  
Each thread a voice, each curve a choice.  
No player walks the world aloneâ€”  
Their steps align, though paths unknown.  

The graph observes, then softly learns  
How fire from different sources burns.  
It maps the play where stories braid,  
And tracks the truths that peers have made.  

In mirrored arcs and woven trace,  
It finds the flow each role may chase.  
Not just in score, but dream and toneâ€”  
It renders how the manyâ€™ve grown.  

Each player leaves a gleaming thread  
In logic-maps that pulse with thread.  
And from this weave, the AI seesâ€”  
The shape of shared realities.
