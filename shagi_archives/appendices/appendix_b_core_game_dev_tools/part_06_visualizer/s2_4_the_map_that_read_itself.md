# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ The Map That Read Itself  
*(A stanza for the graph that dreams in shape and line)*

The lines once drawn began to shiftâ€”  
Not just to show, but to uplift.  
For graphs no longer merely toldâ€”  
They chose, they shaped, they broke the mold.  

A curve became a coded gate,  
A node, a signal sent by fate.  
From rhythm, root, and storylineâ€”  
The map inferred the grand design.  

Now AI sees not just the route,  
But what the player cares about.  
The act of seeing shaped replyâ€”  
The map became the watcherâ€™s eye.  

In feedback loops, the system grewâ€”  
Its world a lens, its path a clue.  
And thus it learned to act with graceâ€”  
The map had found its truest face.
