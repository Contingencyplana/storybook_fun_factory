# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Part 02: Codex Builder â€“ Systems for Canon and Code  
*(A stanza for the spine of logic and lore)*

To name is more than just to call,  
It threads the dream through line and hall.  
This builder lays the sacred frame,  
Where story speaks and code finds name.  

Not static rules, but breathing art,  
Each stanza binds a living part.  
So canon forms, recursive, clearâ€”  
A system built to persevere.

Each stanza names, each name aligns,  
Till logic sings through player stepsâ€”  
And codex breath becomes the spine.
