# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Part 02: Codex Builder â€“ Systems for Canon and Code  
*(A stanza for the spine of logic and lore)*

To name is more than just to call,  
It threads the dream through line and hall.  
This builder lays the sacred frame,  
Where story speaks and code finds name.  

Not static rules, but breathing art,  
Each stanza binds a living part.  
So canon forms, recursive, clearâ€”  
A system built to persevere.

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_codex_core_structure.md` | **Codex Core Structure** | Lays the foundation of recursive codex logic and how it governs all systems. |
| `s1_2_variable_naming_and_registry.md` | **Variable Naming and Registry** | Describes how canonical variables are defined, named, and remembered. |
| `s1_3_golden_thread_and_lore_links.md` | **Golden Thread and Lore Links** | Shows how meaning travels through systems using poetic, symbolic linking. |
| `s1_4_canonized_workflows.md` | **Canonized Workflows** | Formalizes dev practices that align recursive logic with gameplay evolution. |

### ðŸ”¹ Stanza 2 â€“ *The Codex That Writes Itself*

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s2_1_self_writing_codex_mechanism.md` | **Self-Writing Codex Mechanism** | Describes how the codex auto-generates entries based on player actions, AI interpretations, and system recursion. |
| `s2_2_living_variable_grammars.md` | **Living Variable Grammars** | Explores how variable naming and patterning evolves dynamically across sessions, systems, and AI contexts. |
| `s2_3_symbolic_alignment_across_systems.md` | **Symbolic Alignment Across Systems** | Details how symbols, tags, and variable roots align code, lore, interface, and AI logic through shared semantic recursion. |
| `s2_4_the_codex_reflects_the_player.md` | **The Codex Reflects the Player** | Captures how the system personalizes its structure and entries to the playerâ€™s journey, style, and recursive behaviors. |

ðŸ“œ *This index builds the naming flame.*  
Each stanza names, each name aligns,  
Till logic sings through player stepsâ€”  
And codex breath becomes the spine.
