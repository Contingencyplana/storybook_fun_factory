# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Index of Appendix B: Core Game Development Tools for Storybook FUN Factory  
*(A stanza for the forge where tools are named)*

No world is built by myth alone,  
But shaped by tools, by thought, by stone.  
Each script a spark, each test a flameâ€”  
Together bound, they name the game.  

So here begins the workman's scroll,  
A codex not of dream, but role.  
Each tool, each kit, each testing frameâ€”  
A stanza singing code to name.

ðŸ“œ *This index begins the working verse.*  
A codex built from flame and file,  
Where tools recite the world they build,  
And games are born in nested style.
