# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Visualizer â€“ Mapping Recursion into Sight  
*(A stanza for the shapes that thought becomes)*

Where verse is born, the lines must show,  
In arcs and threads the patterns flow.  
To see the code as mind might dreamâ€”  
The visualizer draws the stream.

ðŸ“œ *These diagrams give recursion form.*  
What once was code now sings in shape.
