# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Visualizer â€“ Mapping Recursion into Sight  
*(A stanza for the shapes that thought becomes)*

Where verse is born, the lines must show,  
In arcs and threads the patterns flow.  
To see the code as mind might dreamâ€”  
The visualizer draws the stream.

| `s1_2_poetic_overlay_system.md` | **Poetic Overlay System** | Explores how symbolic and stanza-based overlays enhance visualized flows. |
| `s1_3_flowline_engines_and_logic_arcs.md` | **Flowline Engines and Logic Arcs** | Details the systems responsible for tracing code logic through visual recursion maps. |
| `s1_4_multiplayer_visualization_modes.md` | **Multiplayer Visualization Modes** | Describes how diagrams adapt to represent multiple player interactions and shared recursion layers. |

### ðŸ”¹ Stanza 2 â€“ *When Logic Became a Map*

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s2_1_visual_poetics_and_graphs.md` | **Visual Poetics and Graphs** | Introduces how logic and recursion are translated into poetic visual forms. |
| `s2_2_recursive_feedback_rendering.md` | **Recursive Feedback Rendering** | Describes how AI logic loops, player behavior, and narrative structure are visualized. |
| `s2_3_multiplayer_flowline_inference.md` | **Multiplayer Flowline Inference** | Covers how branching paths across players generate layered graph flows. |
| `s2_4_the_map_that_read_itself.md` | **The Map That Read Itself** | Concludes with how maps influence gameplay and AIâ€”recursion made visible and active. |

ðŸ“œ *These diagrams give recursion form.*  
What once was code now sings in shape.  
Each arc a path, each line a flameâ€”  
The graph itself now speaks the name.
