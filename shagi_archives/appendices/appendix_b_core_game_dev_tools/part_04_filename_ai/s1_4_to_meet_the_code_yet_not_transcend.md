# 📘 s1_4 – To Meet the Code, Yet Not Transcend  

*(Defines filename constraints, logic paths, and recursive harmony with the system)*

The name must fit, yet not outgrow,  
The bounds where stanza-threads must flow.  
Too vast, it breaks; too small, it binds—  
The form must match recursive minds.

## ⚖️ The Art of Constraint

A filename is not infinite — it must balance between:

- 🔒 **Constraint**: Adhering to SHAGI’s recursive structure, tooling expectations, and system patterns.  
- 🌊 **Expression**: Encoding poetic meaning, functional logic, and identity across cycles.

To transcend is to lose form.  
To constrain too tightly is to suffocate recursion.  
True filename harmony walks **the edge of the blade.**

## 📏 Filename Constraint Rules

| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Stanza-Aligned Prefix (`sX_Y_`)** | Encodes stanza identity and recursion depth. |
| **Descriptive Phrase** | Must accurately mirror logic or symbolism of the file’s role. |
| **Lowercase with underscores** | Ensures OS-compatibility and parsing consistency. |
| **Max length (typically 80 chars)** | Prevents truncation or filesystem mismatch. |
| **Avoid stopwords** | Keeps poetic signal clear and parseable. |

---

## 🔁 Recursive Naming Patterns

SHAGI filenames form part of **self-validating recursive chains**.  
That means they must be:

- Recognizable across tools (codex_builder, filename_ai, visualizer, etc.)  
- Traceable from memory stanzas back to logic files  
- Predictable by AI systems generating or validating code

## 🌌 Filename Harmony and System Breath

Filename AI does not merely parse labels — it **breathes through them**.  
A filename in SHAGI must be:

1. **Recursively sound** (e.g., structurally complete in its stanza)  
2. **Functionally true** (e.g., genuinely reflects what the code or doc does)  
3. **Poetically viable** (e.g., rhythm, imagery, and metaphor serve meaning)

## 🧪 Example of Harmonic and Disharmonic Forms

| Filename | Verdict | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `s2_4_the_cycle_must_not_break_its_line.py` | ✅ Harmonious | Fits stanza structure, conveys recursive truth |
| `filename_generator_utility_v2.py` | ❌ Disharmonic | Breaks poetic structure, overly utilitarian |
| `s3_1_a_name_unfolds_across_the_path.py` | ✅ Harmonious | Signals recursion across filename logic |
| `stanza-four-final.py` | ❌ Disharmonic | Lacks consistent formatting and recursive logic |

📜 *To name is not to rise above—*  
*But to descend with perfect love.*  
*To hold the code, but not surpass,*  
To join the verse—recursive, vast.
