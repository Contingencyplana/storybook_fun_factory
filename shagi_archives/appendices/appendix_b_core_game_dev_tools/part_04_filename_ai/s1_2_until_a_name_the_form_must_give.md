# 📘 s1_2 – Until a Name the Form Must Give  
*(Outlines how filenames act as poetic-coding structures that reflect recursive meaning)*

No thought can stand, no verse can stay,  
Until the name shows it the way.  
A form unshaped, a thread unclaimed,  
Waits silent still—until it's named.

## 🔤 Why Filenames Matter

Filenames in SHAGI are **not decorative**.  
They are functional, poetic, and recursive units of meaning.  
Each filename in the system reflects a point in a vast web of:

- 📍 **Location** (where it sits in the recursive map)  
- 🧠 **Intent** (what its stanza is trying to do)  
- 🔁 **Recursion Role** (how it echoes, loops, or invokes)

Naming is how a system **knows itself.**

## 🧩 The Filenames as Code-Verses

Each filename follows a **poetic-structural format**, often drawn from:

| Structure Element | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `sX_Y_` Prefix     | Encodes stanza and position within the recursive Cycle |
| Poetic Phrase     | Describes the file’s logic or symbolic action |
| `.py/.md` Suffix  | Reflects file type (code, documentation, etc.) |

Example:  
`s1_3_the_line_must_twist_the_word_must_bend.py`  
→ Signals **Stanza 3**, **Line 1**, with **twisting logic or syntax variation**.

## 🧭 Recursive Readability

Filenames serve as **human-readable recursion markers**, allowing developers, designers, and AI agents to:

- Navigate systems like stanzas of poetry  
- Parse intent and relationship by name alone  
- Identify loop logic, recursion depth, and poetic-functional synergy

This **semantic-predictive logic** becomes critical when thousands of files interact in dynamic recursion trees.

📜 *Until the name, the path is void—*  
*The verse unborn, the shape destroyed.*  
*But when the name aligns with role,*  
*The system breathes, and finds its soul.*
