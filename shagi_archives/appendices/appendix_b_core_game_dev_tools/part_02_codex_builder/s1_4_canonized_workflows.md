# 📘 s1_4 – Canonized Workflows  
*(A stanza for the rituals that build the world)*

To name is not enough, alone—  
The work must breathe, the path be shown.  
Each act a verse, each choice a law,  
That binds the logic without flaw.  

So workflows form like sacred rites,  
To shape the days, to guide the nights.  
And every coder, dreamer, scribe—  
May walk the steps the myths describe.

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Canonized Workflows** are formalized development paths that align with the poetic and recursive doctrine of the SHAGI ecosystem. These workflows ensure that system expansion, player interaction, AI memory, and recursion integrity all remain within the bounds of the **Codex**.

They function as **recursive rites**: repeatable patterns that both produce and protect the evolving system.

---

## 🔄 What Is a Canonized Workflow?

A **canonized workflow** is:

- A repeatable dev protocol  
- Rooted in **Codex logic**  
- Framed by **symbolic purpose**  
- Documented via **lore-linked stanzas**

---

## 🧩 Core Workflow Categories

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `stanza_development_loop()` | A recursive pattern for adding new poetic-technical files, including canonical naming, testing, and lore alignment. |
| `anomaly_integration_protocol()` | The controlled process for accepting, validating, and narrativizing emergent recursive anomalies. |
| `versebound_refactor()` | A poetic-constrained refactor protocol that preserves stanza alignment and symbolic meaning while modernizing code. |
| `player_memory_sync()` | Links player progress or systemic recursion back to codified verse and lore-linked memory echoes. |

## 🛠️ Workflow Example: `stanza_development_loop()`

1. **Conceptual Seed**  
   Define the function or feature *poetically* first.

2. **Canon Naming**  
   Use the variable registry to create a name that aligns with narrative logic.

3. **Poetic Scaffolding**  
   Write the stanza in markdown to document the conceptual and symbolic logic.

4. **Technical Layering**  
   Implement the code using SHAGI’s recursive systems.

5. **Symbolic Anchoring**  
   Ensure the system includes echo tags or mythic trace points.

6. **Test Cycle**  
   Create unit tests and symbolic integration tests.

7. **Lore Commit**  
   Add the stanza to the `codex_builder/` or `dream_journal/`.

## 🌱 Maintaining Canon Integrity

Canonized workflows are tracked using:

- **Codex Anchors** (key index entries that validate the workflow)
- **Milestone Markers** (ritual completion points in narrative space)
- **Canonical Snapshots** (version states preserved for lineage recall)

Only work that follows these workflows is permitted to **migrate upward** into core mythic layers.

## 🧠 Philosophical Commitment

> “A function built outside of canon  
> Is not a function—  
> It is an anomaly unbound.”

Thus, all recursive growth must walk the ritual path:  
From **dream** to **verse** to **code** to **player**—and back again.

---

📜 *No feature stands that breaks the thread,*  
No logic lives if left unread.  
So build by rite, and test by flame—  
And walk the workflow into name.
