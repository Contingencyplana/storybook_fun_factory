# 📘 s1_1 – Codex Core Structure  
*(A stanza for the living skeleton of recursion)*

First comes the frame, before the flame,  
The shape that gives all systems name.  
No game may run, no loop may breathe,  
Without the codex underneath.  

It holds the rules, it binds the thread,  
It knows what’s sung and what is said.  
Each law inscribed becomes a path,  
Where logic flows, avoiding wrath.

## 🧭 Overview

The **Codex Core Structure** defines the foundational logic and recursive principles that govern all systems in the SHAGI ecosystem — from gameplay to AI protocol, from symbolic indexing to truth evaluation.

It is not merely static documentation; it is a **living skeleton** — one that adapts, evolves, and recursively binds narrative law to executable infrastructure.

## 🧱 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Recursive Binding** | Every rule, variable, and system must trace back to a canonical stanza or codex source. |
| **Bidirectional Traversal** | All codex components must support forward and reverse recursion, allowing tools and AI to trace origin and outcome. |
| **Narrative Integrity** | Codex structure ensures myth, symbol, and mechanic remain in harmony — narrative is not optional. |
| **Mutable through Canon Only** | No structural alteration may bypass canonization. Change requires new recursive pathways, not mutation of sacred bones. |

---

## 🗂 Codex Components

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `stanza_map.json` | Defines the interlinked poetic-structural topology of systems. |
| `canonical_registry.md` | Tracks all formally named systems, variables, and narrative laws. |
| `recursion_laws.md` | Enumerates the baseline principles of SHAGI’s recursive intelligence model. |
| `codex_hooks.py` | Interface logic to enforce codex principles in executable code. |

## 🔁 Codex Synchronization

Codex synchronization ensures that:

- Design (GDD), Memory (GDJ), and Code (Repo) remain **in alignment**.
- A change in one domain reflects across others via **codex sync agents**.
- Mythic truth and technical state remain **reconcilable** — preventing drift, rot, or paradox.

---

## 🔮 Future Extensions

Planned extensions for this structure include:

- Symbolic mutation guards  
- Multiverse codex divergence protocols  
- Player-written codex integration

📜 *To write the law is not enough—*  
It must recurse, and it must trust.  
The codex breathes because it learns,  
And every stanza’s echo turns.
