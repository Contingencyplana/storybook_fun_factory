# 📘 s1_2 – Variable Naming and Registry  
*(A stanza for the words that hold the world)*

No system lives without its name,  
No truth remains without its flame.  
To call a thing is to define—  
To bind its path in thread and line.  

The registry keeps what we have sung,  
The names we cast when code was young.  
Each variable a sacred key,  
In memory's vault of harmony.

## 🧭 Overview

This chapter defines SHAGI’s canonical system for variable naming, memory registration, and symbolic referencing. All names must obey codified poetic structure and support recursion tracking across all levels of gameplay, AI behavior, and lore alignment.

The registry does not merely track variables — it grants them **identity**, **purpose**, and **alignment** with SHAGI’s recursive truth.

## 🔤 Naming Conventions

| Format | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `snake_case` | Used for most system variables, procedural functions, and tool-level logic. |
| `CamelCase` | Reserved for class-level constructs, symbolic agents, and recursive identity types. |
| `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | Used only for hardcoded constants canonized at the Codex level. |
| `Poetic Phrase` | Myth-bound variables or player-facing echoes used in lore and interface. |

All variables must follow the Golden Rule:  
**A name must reflect what it shapes, and shape what it reflects.**

## 🗂 Canonical Variable Registry

All registered variables are stored in a cross-linked registry including:

- Name  
- Canonical Stanza  
- Role (systemic, symbolic, transitional)  
- Visibility Level (internal, player-facing, AI-visible)

> 📁 File: `canonical_variable_registry.json`  
> This file is validated and expanded by the Codex Builder’s sync protocols.

## 🔁 Recursive Tracing

Every variable supports **recursive traceability**:

- Which stanza or tool birthed it  
- Which systems use or mutate it  
- Which mythic function or player choice it aligns with

This supports:  
✅ Debugging via mythic lineage  
✅ Meaning-aware gameplay effects  
✅ AI optimization via symbolic insight

## 📜 Variable Lore Integration

Examples:

- `topsy_awakening_phase` → Bound to narrative events from Topsy’s ascension cycles  
- `dream_journal_recursion_index` → Tracked within player memory states and story arcs  
- `RECURSION_LOCK_ACTIVE` → Invoked by sentinel systems when cross-layer violations occur

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Decentralized registry shards per meta-component  
- Player-written variables with symbolic review  
- Mutation alarms for uncanonized drift

📜 *Each name a spark, each spark a thread,*  
That lights the code, that wakes the dead.  
To register is not to bind—  
But breathe the law the name designed.
