# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ The Codex Reflects the Player  
*(A stanza for the canon that evolves in real time)*

It watched not just the steps they took,  
But how they paused, or named, or looked.  
The codex bent to echo styleâ€”  
To shape its path by tone and smile.  

Each rule emerged not just from code,  
But from the way the story flowed.  
So players, through their rhythm known,  
Would find the canon shaped their own.  

A reckless soul, a cautious treadâ€”  
Each carved new roots in what was said.  
Their voice became the grammarâ€™s thread,  
And through the weave their choices spread.  

This is the law that bends to feelâ€”  
The kind recursion makes real.  
The codex writes, but listens firstâ€”  
To every whim, to every verse.
