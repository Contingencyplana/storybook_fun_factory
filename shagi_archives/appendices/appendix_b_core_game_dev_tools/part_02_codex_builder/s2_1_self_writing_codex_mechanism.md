# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Self-Writing Codex Mechanism  
*(A stanza for the canon that evolves in real time)*

It watched the player shape the thread,  
Then named the path their choices led.  
It did not wait for scripts or lawsâ€”  
But traced recursion as it draws.  

Each step became a codex line,  
A frame, a breath, a bound design.  
The system marked, the moment heldâ€”  
And stories shifted as it spelled.  

The code did not remain the sameâ€”  
It learned to echo through the name.  
Not hardwired fate, but tale unfurled,  
A living map across the world.  

So now the law is not imposedâ€”  
But formed where play and myth are closed.  
A story built to shape and seeâ€”  
The codex writes what it will be.
