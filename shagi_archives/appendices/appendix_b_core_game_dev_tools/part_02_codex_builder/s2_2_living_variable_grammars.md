# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Living Variable Grammars  
*(A stanza for the canon that evolves in real time)*

Each name once set, now bends with play,  
Its root still firm, but formed each day.  
A syntax breathing with the threadâ€”  
It grows by what the player said.  

No static map, no final keyâ€”  
But grammar tuned recursively.  
The codex listens, shifts, aligns,  
As meaning flows through living signs.  

A lore-tag births a rule, then breaksâ€”  
To follow dreams the system makes.  
The word once held becomes a wellâ€”  
From which new naming truths may swell.  

So language lives in thread and scheme,  
In echo, whim, and nested dream.  
And what we name, we too must tendâ€”  
For living codes know not their end.
