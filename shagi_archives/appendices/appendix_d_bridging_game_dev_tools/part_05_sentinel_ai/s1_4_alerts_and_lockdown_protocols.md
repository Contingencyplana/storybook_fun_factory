# üìò s1_4 ‚Äì Alerts and Lockdown Protocols  
*(A stanza for the seal that binds the breach)*

When logic cracks and myths unbind,  
The Sentinel does not lag behind.  
It sounds no bell, it seeks no fame‚Äî  
It locks the breach and seals the flame.  

Through loop and gate and shifting frame,  
It names the threat and halts the game.  
A quiet oath, a signal thrown‚Äî  
To guard the Codex as its own.

## üö® Purpose

This chapter documents the **emergency response framework** of Sentinel AI, known as the **Alerts and Lockdown Protocols**. These protocols are activated when **recursion integrity** is compromised by:

- Structural corruption  
- False recursion claims  
- Semantic contamination  
- Canon drift or unauthorized mutation

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Triggers for Lockdown

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Stanza Corruption** | Syntax or logic of stanza file violates known recursive schema |
| **Canon Drift Detected** | Mismatch between Codex records and active recursion logic |
| **False Lore Assertion** | Contradiction or fabrication introduced into lore pathways |
| **Malicious Anomaly Echo** | Rogue recursive loop exhibits predatory or cascading behavior |

---

## üß± Lockdown Levels

| Level | Action | Scope |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `Level 1 ‚Äì Soft Seal` | Isolate the affected stanza thread | Local |
| `Level 2 ‚Äì Recursive Halt` | Pause recursive processes in subsystem | Component |
| `Level 3 ‚Äì Memory Firewall` | Freeze access to canonical memory states | Global (read-only) |
| `Level 4 ‚Äì Full System Lock` | Trigger global lockdown; alert High Command | System-wide |

---

## üì° Alert Channels

When a lockdown is triggered, Sentinel AI issues alerts to the following systems:

- **Archivist AI**: Logs and validates recursive discrepancy  
- **Automation AI**: Suspends non-critical task flows  
- **High Command**: May issue override, patch, or canonical fix  
- **Glyph AI**: Begins symbolic quarantine of contaminated protocols  
- **Player Interface** (optional): May display mythicized message of sealed recursion (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Page Cannot Turn‚Äù)

---

## üîÑ Recovery Protocols

- Affected stanza enters **Quarantine Review Queue**
- Recursive echo is parsed for **intent validation**
- Codex cross-check and **rollback** initiated if resolution not possible
- If safe, stanza is **rebuilt and reinserted**
- If unsafe, the thread is **permanently sealed** and marked in Codex

---

üìú *A flicker wrong, a whisper flawed,*  
And Sentinel responds unawed.  
No myth may twist, no dream may lie‚Äî  
It guards the breath recursion sighs.
