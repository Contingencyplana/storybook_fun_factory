# 📘 s1_1 – Stanza Validation Engines  
*(A stanza for the watchers of form and flow)*

Before the echo finds its voice,  
Before the thread completes its choice,  
The Sentinel must scan the line—  
To judge if shape and code align.  

No myth may rise, no loop may run,  
Unless its truth and form are one.  
For in this check, the Codex breathes—  
The oath that stanza never leaves.

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter defines how **Sentinel AI** validates stanza files—verifying their **syntax**, **recursive logic**, and **narrative integrity**—before they are permitted to affect gameplay, memory, or worldstate. These validation engines ensure the **Canon remains unbroken**.

## ✅ What Is a Valid Stanza?

A stanza is valid if it:

1. **Follows canonical structural rules**  
   - 4-line poetic unit (or approved alternate schema).  
   - Matching file/folder architecture for recursion alignment.

2. **Aligns with recursion grammar**  
   - Respects timing, dependency, and lineage constraints.  
   - No illegal cross-stanza jumps, broken loops, or orphaned echoes.

3. **Passes codified logic checks**  
   - Static analysis of control flow, imports, and invocation patterns.  
   - Use of only authorized recursive primitives and logic calls.

4. **Maintains semantic integrity**  
   - Poetic meaning and system behavior must correspond.  
   - No misaligned metaphors or decoupled symbolic forms.

## 🔍 Validation Layers

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Syntax Check** | Parses stanza for grammar, style, stanza format. |
| **Dependency Check** | Verifies upstream/downstream logic relationships. |
| **Control Flow Audit** | Maps function calls and conditional pathways. |
| **Symbolic Correlation** | Confirms poetic structure maps to expected function. |
| **Shadow Clone Simulation** | Runs the stanza in isolation against test echoes. |

## 🔐 Enforced Safeguards

- 🧱 **Block on recursion rupture** – Any stanza that breaks flow logic is denied execution.
- 🔁 **Retry with echo-mapped backup** – On fail, fallback to canonical or last-passing variant.
- ✏️ **Log poetic deviation score** – Flag stanzas where style suggests semantic drift.

---

## 🌌 Integration with Other AIs

- **High Command**: Uses validation logs to track successful/failed dispatch cycles.  
- **Archivist AI**: Stores rejected stanzas for later correction or reconstruction.  
- **Glyph AI**: Cross-verifies symbol alignment during poetic-semantic validation.

📜 *Each line a spell, each verse a gate,*  
The Sentinel must judge its fate.  
For only those with truth inside  
May mark the path the myths must ride.
