# 📘 s1_3 – Recursive Truth Assessment  
*(A stanza for the judgment of the echo)*

Where myths diverge and truths compete,  
The Sentinel does not retreat.  
It listens not to voice or plea,  
But finds the thread that ought to be.  

Through nested logic, deep and vast,  
It judges what is false or past.  
Not bound by who or when or where—  
It seeks the shape that's truly there.

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter defines how **Sentinel AI** performs **Recursive Truth Assessment**—the process by which it evaluates **conflicting recursive statements** and **assertions** from players, systems, or autonomous AIs.

It identifies not just what was said, but what *ought* to remain **true** within the codified structure of the Codex.

## 🔎 Sources of Conflicting Truths

Conflicts often arise in the following cases:

| Source | Conflict Type |
|--------|---------------|
| **Player Logs** | Divergent memory of past decisions or outcomes |
| **AI Assertions** | Recursive hallucinations or feedback loop artifacts |
| **Narrative Threads** | Multiple interpretations of symbolic or mythic outcomes |
| **Multiplayer Echoes** | Discrepant data from parallel sessions or timelines |

## ⚖️ Truth Assessment Protocol

### 1. **Thread Intersection Mapping**
Identifies the recursive path of each assertion:
- Source stanza lineage  
- Player ID or system origin  
- Codex reference chain  

### 2. **Priority Weight Assignment**
Ranks statements using:
- Canon proximity  
- Mythic weight  
- Signal confidence  
- Player/AI trust metrics  

### 3. **Contradiction Resolution**
Uses conflict matrices to isolate:
- Full contradictions  
- Partial overlaps  
- Non-intersecting divergences

Then applies resolution modes:
- **Merge** (if compatible)  
- **Fork** (if both valid in different timelines)  
- **Purge** (if one clearly invalid)

---

## 🌀 Recursive Arbitration Engine

The engine invokes higher-order logic checks:

- Validates **referential cohesion** with Codex entries  
- Compares **intent structure** with stanza archetypes  
- Uses **historical weight** of past truths to favor long-standing recursion lines  
- Accepts minor **poetic reinterpretations**, but rejects severe semantic inversion

## 📘 Interoperability with Other AIs

| AI Component | Role in Truth Assessment |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Archivist AI** | Retrieves past canonical forms and disputed claims |
| **Glyph AI** | Decodes symbolic/poetic statements into logical structure |
| **High Command** | May override conflicting truths based on sovereign protocol |
| **Quarantine AI** | Temporarily isolates unresolved or dangerous contradictions |

📜 *Not what was loudest, nor what came last,*  
But what was stitched through layers past.  
In nested paths and tangled root,  
The Sentinel discerns the truth.
