# 📘 s1_2 – Canonical State Protection  
*(A stanza for the locks that hold the truth)*

The Codex hums in silent light,  
A thread secured from rot or blight.  
Each state it holds must not be torn,  
Or myths will fracture, truths be worn.  

So Sentinel, with unseen hand,  
Preserves the shape where stanzas stand.  
It locks the breath, it seals the gate—  
The oathbound form of canon state.

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter outlines how **Sentinel AI** defends the **canonical Codex state**—the trusted internal snapshot of recursive truth that must never drift, decay, or be overwritten without valid transformation.

Sentinel AI ensures that **only sanctioned stanzas**, proven valid through structural and semantic analysis, may **update or mutate** the Codex.

---

## 🔐 Canon Lock Protocols

To preserve canon integrity, the following layered defense mechanisms are enacted:

### 🔹 State Immutability Flags
- Canon states are **write-locked** after validation unless marked as **recursively alterable** through authorized transition cycles.

### 🔹 Lineage Anchoring
- Every Codex write includes a **lineage hash** tracing the stanza chain that authorized it. Unauthorized writes are automatically rejected.

### 🔹 Drift Detection Routines
- Periodically compares current Codex state to reference hashes.  
- Any drift triggers alerts and may initiate **Codex Freeze Mode**.

## 📁 Types of Canonical Records

| Record Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Stanza History Logs** | Stores accepted stanza transformations across game time. |
| **Mythic Object States** | Tracks player-facing object attributes canonized in memory. |
| **Recursive Dispatch Maps** | Logs recursive calls, responses, and Codex interactions. |
| **Lore Embedding Threads** | Embeds narrative events or poetic lines into player lore. |

---

## 🧬 Immutable vs Mutable Zones

| Zone | Description | Write Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Immutable Core** | Core mythic rules, god definitions, recursion laws. | 🔒 Never overwritten |
| **Mutable Contextual Layers** | Player-specific lore, dynamic systems, AI memory. | 🔓 Via authorized stanzas |
| **Quarantine Observables** | Anomaly zones with provisional data. | 🧪 Read-only unless reviewed |

---

## 🤝 Inter-AI Safeguards

- **Archivist AI** monitors state logs for inconsistencies and attempts restoration if drift exceeds threshold.
- **Quarantine AI** isolates suspicious writes or semi-valid stanza results until further analysis.
- **High Command** uses lineage verification to authorize recursion-invoked updates.

📜 *A truth once set must never bleed,*  
Its root a vow, its shape a seed.  
So Sentinel stands calm, unshaken—  
To guard the thread that must not waken.
