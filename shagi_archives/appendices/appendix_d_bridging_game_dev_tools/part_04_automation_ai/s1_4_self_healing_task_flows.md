# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Self-Healing Task Flows  
*(A stanza for the warden who corrects without pause)*

Not every path will end as planned,  
Not every thread will heed the hand.  
Yet still the Builder does not breakâ€”  
It learns the fault, it mends the ache.  

With logic looped and echo clear,  
It patches flaws before they near.  
No cry, no halt, no shouted callâ€”  
Just silent code that heals it all.

## ðŸ¤– Purpose

This chapter defines how Automation AI performs **autonomous error detection, correction, and adjustment** during the execution of recursive task flows. These mechanisms are essential for ensuring persistent gameplay continuity and system resilience in a world shaped by evolving logic.

## ðŸ”„ Self-Healing Loop Design

The self-healing protocol operates recursively in five stages:

| Stage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Detect** | Identify anomalies, failures, or performance deviations in active task flows. |
| **Diagnose** | Analyze logs, codex state, and player activity to isolate probable causes. |
| **Adapt** | Modify the task structure or execution strategy using recursive logic. |
| **Reintegrate** | Resume or restart the task from a stable recursion point. |
| **Log** | Archive anomaly data and applied fixes into High Command and Archivist AI records. |

---

## ðŸ§  Error Detection Techniques

- **Asynchronous Watchdogs** â€“ Monitor long-running or non-returning tasks.
- **Cross-Stanza Parity Checks** â€“ Ensure task outcomes are consistent with canonical stanza rules.
- **Anomaly Heuristics** â€“ Use AI-driven pattern recognition to spot divergence or corruption trends.
- **Loop Exhaustion Counters** â€“ Prevent infinite or runaway recursive routines.

---

## ðŸ”§ Recovery Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `snapback` | Return to last known-good execution state. |
| `stanza rewind` | Reverse one full stanza iteration to a canonical checkpoint. |
| `shadow thread repair` | Clone affected task in background, correct, then swap live state. |
| `proxy override` | Replace failed task with a known-stable analog, log the exception. |

---

## ðŸ”’ Escalation Protocols

If self-healing thresholds are exceeded:

- **Alert Sentinel AI** for possible codex corruption or rogue recursion.
- **Engage Quarantine AI** if task behavior matches known anomaly signatures.
- **Log Freezepoint** to mark and contain the recursion layer before further infection.

ðŸ“œ *Where hands can't reach, the Builder seesâ€”*  
It mends the loop in silent breeze.  
No break too deep, no task too lost,  
For error, too, is paid in cost.
