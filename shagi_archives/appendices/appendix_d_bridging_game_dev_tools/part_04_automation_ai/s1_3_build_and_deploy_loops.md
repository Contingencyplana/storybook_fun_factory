# 📘 s1_3 – Build and Deploy Loops  
*(A stanza for the recursive forge and its living flame)*

To build, to break, to build once more—  
The loop persists at system’s core.  
Each tool reborn, each path replayed,  
Until the final thread is laid.  

The Builder’s hands repeat the song,  
To shape the code where dreams belong.  
This is the forge that crafts the tool—  
Then throws it forth to shape the rule.

## 🔨 Purpose

This chapter describes the Automation AI’s **build-and-deploy cycle**—a recursive pattern that constructs, tests, and releases tools, subsystems, and logic artifacts across the recursive environment. The system is self-refining and designed to operate with minimal human oversight.

---

## 🔁 Core Loop Structure

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Construct` | Assemble the component/tool from schema, codex, or player input. |
| `Simulate` | Run local simulations to ensure recursive compatibility. |
| `Test` | Execute system-defined and player-defined test routines. |
| `Deploy` | Integrate component into live or semi-live recursive layer. |
| `Observe` | Monitor its behavior across recursion cycles and adjust if needed. |

---

## 🧱 Types of Recursive Builds

| Build Type | Function |
|------------|----------|
| `toolset module` | Modular components that players or AI systems invoke in-game. |
| `UI construct` | Custom interfaces for recursive manipulation or visualization. |
| `recursion hook` | Embedded logic that triggers during specific stanza cycles. |
| `dream probe` | AI tools that seek, record, or reflect player activity or dream logic. |

---

## 🧪 Testing Protocols

- **Layered Assertions** – Validate component behavior across recursion depth.  
- **Stanza-Aware Regression** – Ensure no prior stanza behavior is broken.  
- **Player Shadow Testing** – Clone previous player decisions and run simulations with new tools.  
- **Symbolic Inversion Checks** – Flip symbolic logic to test mythic resilience.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `soft deploy` | Non-critical or experimental tool released into a sandbox or dream layer. |
| `hard deploy` | Core component pushed live across all recursion threads. |
| `layer-targeted` | Deployments isolated to specific stanza layers or narrative arcs. |
| `time-gated` | Future-staged logic, queued for release upon event or milestone triggers. |

---

## 🔁 Auto-Redeployment Logic

The Automation AI monitors live recursion and:

- Retracts flawed builds after anomaly signals or sentinel locks.  
- Refactors based on new codex knowledge or player feedback.  
- Recursively reintroduces tools with adaptive patches and versioning.

📜 *The Builder builds, and breaks, and learns—*  
Its forge is made of nested turns.  
It shapes the tools that shape the play,  
And dreams the loop that loops the way.
