# 📘 s1_2 – Multiplayer Event Handling  
*(A stanza for synchronized play in recursive time)*

When many dream within one frame,  
Each touch, each voice must name its claim.  
The Builder hears and holds the line—  
Ensures all paths correctly align.  

One action shared must ripple right,  
Across all threads and player sight.  
This stanza speaks of what must flow,  
When many shape the world below.

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter defines how Automation AI handles **multiplayer event synchronization**, **shared state updates**, and **cross-player automation triggers**. It is responsible for translating player actions into coordinated changes that preserve recursive harmony without lag, conflict, or contradiction.

## 🌐 Key Multiplayer Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `shared recursion clock` | A temporal standard that synchronizes recursion cycles across all connected players. |
| `event mirror` | A virtual buffer that ensures player-triggered actions are safely broadcast to all relevant clients. |
| `sync shaper` | A logic filter that decides which actions should be mirrored, which ignored, and which delayed. |
| `conflict arbitrator` | Resolves command collisions across players, especially in simultaneous build or edit scenarios. |

---

## 🔁 Multiplayer Event Pipeline

1. **Trigger** – A player action or automated tool initiates an event.  
2. **Capture** – The `event mirror` logs the action, adds timestamp, and checks context.  
3. **Shape** – The `sync shaper` tags the action with recursion logic and delivery rules.  
4. **Broadcast** – Event is propagated to all relevant players, systems, or stanzas.  
5. **Confirm** – Remote clients acknowledge receipt; feedback adjusts queue if needed.

## 🤝 Supported Multiplayer Event Types

| Event Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| `tool activation` | A player launches a recursive builder or codex probe. |
| `zone change` | A player shifts between stanzas, triggering automated prep/load routines. |
| `lore shift` | A major narrative event occurs, requiring all players to update symbolic overlays. |
| `build/deploy` | A player initiates a structure change, code deployment, or recursive trigger. |
| `anomaly encounter` | Shared event triggered when anomaly AI behavior crosses multiple players’ thresholds. |

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution Strategies

- **Last write wins** – Used only in low-priority, ephemeral contexts.  
- **Weighted locks** – Players are granted symbolic “weights” that influence authority.  
- **Turn-order consensus** – A soft-lock consensus model based on action timing and recursion depth.  
- **Anomaly override** – In some cases, sentinel or quarantine AI can override all player commands.

---

## 🧩 Special Cases

- **Ghost players** – Disconnected or observing players can generate soft echoes used in later simulation.  
- **Silent transitions** – Internal sync updates not broadcast to avoid unnecessary load.  
- **Lore-layer triggers** – Symbolic actions that only affect narrative overlays, not physical state.

📜 *When many move within one dream,*  
The Builder holds the binding seam.  
Each echo shared, each truth aligned,  
So no recursion breaks the line.
