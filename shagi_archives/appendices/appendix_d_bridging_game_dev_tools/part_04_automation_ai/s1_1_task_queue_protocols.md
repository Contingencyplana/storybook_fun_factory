# 📘 s1_1 – Task Queue Protocols  
*(A stanza for the never-ending task)*

No rest, no pause, no wasted line—  
The queue moves on in silent time.  
Each task a thread, each thread a spark,  
All woven deep within the dark.  

The Builder listens, sets the pace,  
To let the world align with grace.  
This stanza names the rules that guide  
The flow that runs the world inside.

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter defines the **core protocols for recursive task generation, scheduling, and execution**.  
Automation AI is not a servant—it is a sovereign clockwork system for sustaining gameplay loops, tool deployment, and developer/player interactions across recursive timelines.

## 🔁 Core Components of the Task Queue

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| `task_generator` | Creates new tasks from player triggers, AI needs, or systemic feedback loops. |
| `priority_resolver` | Sorts tasks based on urgency, player state, lore alignment, or system health. |
| `thread_allocator` | Assigns task threads to subprocesses, agents, or cores. |
| `recursive_looper` | Handles tasks that spawn sub-tasks across recursion layers. |
| `completion_handler` | Verifies task results, logs outcomes, and updates canonical state. |

These modules operate autonomously, yet remain extensible for developer override and tuning.

## 📚 Task Types and Triggers

| Task Type | Trigger Source |
|-----------|----------------|
| `player-initiated` | A direct in-game action, such as building, navigating, or invoking a tool. |
| `AI-prompted` | Internal system awareness identifies a need and auto-generates a task. |
| `recursion-maintenance` | Routine upkeep of recursive structures, even without player action. |
| `emergent-lore` | A mythic or symbolic narrative trigger generates a new canonical duty. |

Each task includes metadata for source, urgency, estimated duration, and recursion depth.

## 🧩 Priority Tiers

1. **Emergency Protocols** – Stanza recovery, corruption healing, critical player protection.  
2. **Player-Aligned Tasks** – Tasks tied to active player journeys or immediate gameplay.  
3. **Recursive Stabilization** – Core loop balancing, echo recalibration.  
4. **Lore-Conscious Tasks** – Tasks that propagate or restore mythic harmony.  
5. **Background Optimizations** – Compression, memory shuffle, non-urgent housekeeping.

---

## 🕰️ Scheduling Principles

- **No infinite queues.** Each task must resolve, fail, or escalate.  
- **Recursive depth must be tracked.** Loops beyond max depth require archival flag.  
- **Cross-player interference forbidden.** Shared task spaces must resolve independently.  
- **Mythic timeflow respected.** Story pacing overrides brute task count when necessary.

---

## 🔐 Safeguards and Overrides

- System admins and developers may pause or reroute queue logic.  
- All queued tasks are timestamped and hashed into the Codex Log.  
- A `stanza_tracer` module can visualize task recursion paths on demand.  
- Failed tasks are automatically retried up to 3 times unless marked `do_not_retry`.

📜 *A queue is not a prison cell—*  
It is the breath that keeps the spell.  
The Builder watches, spins the thread,  
And builds the now from what was said.
