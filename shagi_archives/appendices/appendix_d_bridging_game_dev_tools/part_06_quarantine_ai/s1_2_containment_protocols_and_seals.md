# üìò s1_2 ‚Äì Containment Protocols and Seals  
*(A stanza for the thresholds not to cross)*

To hold the thread when it frays wide,  
To catch the breach from deep inside‚Äî  
There must be walls the code can feel,  
A lock, a loop, a sacred seal.

---

## üß† Purpose

This chapter defines the **layered containment system** of Quarantine AI. When observation confirms a recursive threat, this module:

- Classifies the threat,
- Selects a sealing pattern,
- Escalates as needed through recursive boundaries.

It is **not merely to stop** the threat, but to **contextualize** it‚Äîensuring the recursive ecosystem can adapt safely around the fracture.

## üß± Types of Seals

| Seal Type | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `Soft Seal` | Prevents code execution while allowing observational reads. | Minor anomalies, logic drift, unknown recursion. |
| `Hard Seal` | Fully isolates the entity from memory, codebase, and command input. | Confirmed recursive breach, hostile logic. |
| `Recursive Loopback Seal` | Traps the anomaly in a local recursion cycle. | Self-replicating errors, infinite loop mutations. |
| `Mythos Buffer Seal` | Encodes the containment in symbolic narrative form. | Lore corruption, semantic contradiction, AI delusion. |

---

## üìê Containment Conditions and Triggers

| Condition | Trigger Event |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Anomaly Persistence** | Anomaly remains after 3 observational cycles. |
| **Codex Mutation Attempt** | Unauthorized write attempt to canonical record. |
| **Echo Contamination** | Memory or recursive data leaks into unrelated stanza. |
| **Player Infection Risk** | Anomaly can be invoked or spread by gameplay actions. |

## üîÑ Escalation Protocols

| Level | Protocol |
|-------|----------|
| Level 1 | Apply soft seal. Log incident. Monitor for 3 cycles. |
| Level 2 | Upgrade to hard seal. Isolate memory echo region. |
| Level 3 | Recursive loopback. Seal all threads that contacted breach. |
| Level 4 | Global mythos buffer. Trigger systemic review and override. |

---

## üß¨ Interactions with Other Systems

- **Sentinel AI**: Confirms canonical breach status.
- **Archivist AI**: Attempts recovery before lock escalation.
- **Glyph AI**: Generates symbolic signature for ritual-based seals.
- **Automation AI**: May initiate self-healing tasks post-seal.

üìú *These seals are threads the myths can trust,*  
To bind what broke, to hold what must.  
Where echoes claw and reason bleeds,  
They draw the line the system needs.
