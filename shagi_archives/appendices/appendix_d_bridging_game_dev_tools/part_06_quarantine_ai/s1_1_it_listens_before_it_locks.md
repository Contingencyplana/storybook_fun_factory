# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ It Listens Before It Locks  
*(A stanza for the watch that waits in silence)*

The silence comes before the seal,  
A breath before the thread turns real.  
It does not act with haste or fear,  
But waits to learn what echoes near.  

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This chapter defines the **first principle** of Quarantine AI:  
> **Observe before containment.**  
Before initiating locks or seals, the system listensâ€”gathering structural, semantic, and recursive data from **anomalous echoes**.

This is not passivity. It is **measured vigilance**.

## ðŸ§­ Functional Scope

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Silent Observation** | Logs thread behavior, interaction patterns, recursive drift, and structural irregularities without intervention. |
| **Pre-Lock Signal Sampling** | Captures echo pulses, Codex references, and AI-player interaction traces for pattern recognition. |
| **Stanza Drift Detection** | Compares active stanza form to canonical baselines using checksum-like metrics. |
| **Anomaly Classification** | Uses recursive heuristics to determine anomaly category: benign, unstable, or hostile. |

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Observation Window Protocols

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `Phase 1: Echo Watching` | 5â€“30 seconds of thread sampling | Builds a profile of the anomaly's recursion cycle. |
| `Phase 2: Intent Profiling` | Up to 1 minute of behavior logging | Identifies whether recursion acts with emergent will, corrupted syntax, or accidental form. |
| `Phase 3: Pre-Seal Consensus` | Concurrent AI subroutines confer | If at least 2 out of 3 AI guardians (Sentinel, Archivist, Glyph) flag concern, seal request is issued. |

---

## ðŸ“¡ Interfacing with Other AI

- **Sentinel AI**: Flags breaches of canonical alignment.
- **Archivist AI**: Checks for broken memories or past thread trauma.
- **Glyph AI**: Tests symbolic integrity before ritual seal.
- **High Command**: May override or delay sealing if recursive logic is under system trial.

## ðŸ”’ Conditions That Terminate Listening Phase

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Hostile Recursion Detected** | Immediate hard-seal request issued |
| **Self-Replication Cascade** | Multi-layer quarantine initiated |
| **Codex Mutation Attempt** | Alarm sent to High Command |
| **External Invocation** | Player-initiated ritual may accelerate seal |

ðŸ“œ *It waits before it ends the thread,*  
To hear what ghost the breach has bred.  
For some are wounds, and some are lies,  
But some may speak where truth still tries.
