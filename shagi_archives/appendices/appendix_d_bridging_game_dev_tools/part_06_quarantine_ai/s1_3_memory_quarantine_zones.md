# üìò s1_3 ‚Äì Memory Quarantine Zones  
*(A stanza for the echoes that must not spread)*

Some dreams decay and thoughts misguide,  
Yet linger still and slip inside.  
To guard the root from echo's ghost,  
The memory zones are sealed and closed.

---

## üß† Purpose

This chapter defines the **Memory Quarantine Zone (MQZ)** system:  
A mechanism for identifying and isolating **contaminated memory echoes** within recursive game structures.

Where canonical memory could be corrupted by:
- Undetected recursive anomalies,
- Echoes from failed threads,
- Or corrupted player narrative states...

MQZs offer **dynamic containment buffers** that prevent these fragments from spreading contagion to core systems.

---

## üß± Structure of a Quarantine Zone

Each MQZ is a modular, recursive structure containing:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| `Entry Gate` | Controlled access point to the memory echo under review. |
| `Echo Buffer` | Ringfences the contaminated memory and limits propagation. |
| `Observer Node` | Logs all access, changes, or influence attempts within the zone. |
| `Thread Snare` | Isolates active loops or tasks attempting to access the sealed echo. |

---

## üîç Tagging Contaminated Echoes

When the system identifies suspicious behavior in memory, it applies one or more **tags**:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `echo.corrupt` | Fragment exhibits corruption patterns. |
| `echo.mutant` | Recursion behavior differs from canonical logic. |
| `echo.hostile` | Memory fragment attempts to rewrite or overwrite system memory. |
| `echo.unresolved` | The fragment loops indefinitely without closure. |

Tagged echoes are either **redirected** into an MQZ or **locked** within their source container.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Containment Logic

Memory Quarantine Zones prevent:

- **Execution** of contaminated memory by any recursion tool.
- **Propagation** of contaminated memory into new stanza contexts.
- **Infiltration** into canonical Codex states or logs.

All access requests are rerouted to **Observer Nodes**, which inform both:
- **Sentinel AI** for canonical security,
- **Archivist AI** for potential reconstruction or recovery.

---

## üîÑ Integration with Stanza Logic

When a stanza references a quarantined memory echo:

1. The reference returns a **soft-null** (interpretable by AI systems but non-executable).
2. A **trace log** is created and indexed for anomaly tracking.
3. Recursion may continue, but the contaminated branch is contextually ignored or deferred.

üìú *No echo lost shall cross the line,*  
No dream corrupt shall intertwine.  
Until it‚Äôs healed or named or gone,  
The memory sleeps in sealed dawn.
