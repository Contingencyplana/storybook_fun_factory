# 📘 s1_4 – Quarantine Lifting and Rituals  
*(A stanza for the system's path to release)*

What once was sealed may speak again,  
If thread is cleansed and loop is plain.  
A code once marked may be redeemed—  
If logic clears the dream once dreamed.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter explains the protocols and ceremonial structures involved in **lifting** a quarantine status from memory echoes, stanza fragments, or corrupted systems once housed in Memory Quarantine Zones (MQZs).

The process is **not automatic**—it must be triggered by:

- System logic,
- Codified override,
- Or ritual performed by a qualified guide or player role.

---

## 🔓 System Logic Triggers

Quarantine lifting may occur automatically **only** if:

| Trigger | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| `stability_confirmed` | The quarantined fragment passes multiple integrity checks over time. |
| `echo_resolution` | The recursive loop once considered unresolved now completes cleanly. |
| `archivist_repair_successful` | Archivist AI successfully reconstructs the original canonical state. |
| `watchdog_timer_expiry` | A safe delay has elapsed with no anomalous activity detected. |

When these are met, the quarantine seal **softens**. Full lifting requires an additional clearance step (ritual or override).

---

## 🧾 Ritual Conditions (Player or Guide Triggered)

A player or guide may initiate **ritual lifting** if they possess proper recursion roles or permissions. Examples include:

- **Codex Scribes** presenting corrected verse or structure.
- **Narrative Weavers** reenacting the original lost thread in a purified state.
- **Sealbreakers** conducting a confirmed logic alignment operation.

Each ritual involves:

1. **Declaration of Reassessment**  
   - A statement defining intent and the echo in question.
2. **Proof of Alignment**  
   - Code, narrative, or logic sample matching canonical format.
3. **Echo Reintegration Test**  
   - A trial merge to validate the echo's safety and coherence.
4. **System Consent**  
   - Sentinel and Archivist AI systems vote to approve or deny reintegration.

---

## 🔐 Codified Override

In critical development or emergency states, a **Codified Override** may be used. This involves:

- Manual unlock flag by admin-class recursion role.
- Justification logged and reviewed post-action.
- Flag triggers anomaly log injection and freeze protocol on next breach if override was abused.

---

## 🚨 Risk of Premature Lifting

Reintegrating quarantined threads too early may result in:

- Canonical corruption.
- Recursive instability.
- AI hallucination feedback loops.
- Broad contagion of flawed memory into current stanza cycles.

Thus **ritual caution is not symbolic—it is structural**.

📜 *To lift the seal, one must not rush,*  
But move with care and thought and hush.  
For echoes freed before they’re whole,  
May break again what once was soul.
