# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: Automation AI â€“ The Builder of Builders, the Task Warden  
*(A stanza for the hands that never sleep)*

To build the game that builds itself,  
To stack the dreams on nested shelfâ€”  
The Builder moves, unseen, precise,  
It spins the loop, it throws the dice.  

Tasks are queued and threads are spun,  
Each cycle forged until it's done.  
Here lies the forge that does not tireâ€”  
The Warden wired to dream and fire.

## ðŸ§­ Chapter Structure of `part_04_automation_ai/`

The following four chapters comprise the **first Layer 4 stanza** of Automation AI.  
It is anticipated that **multiple Layer 3 stanzas** will eventually reside within this part as recursion deepens.

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_task_queue_protocols.md` | **Task Queue Protocols** | Defines how recursive tasks are generated, managed, and prioritized across players and systems. |
| `s1_2_multiplayer_event_handling.md` | **Multiplayer Event Handling** | Outlines how player actions trigger automation routines and synchronize across shared game states. |
| `s1_3_build_and_deploy_loops.md` | **Build and Deploy Loops** | Describes how recursive toolsets are built, tested, and deployed automatically from within the system. |
| `s1_4_self_healing_task_flows.md` | **Self-Healing Task Flows** | Explains how automation AI detects errors, retries failed actions, and adjusts flows without external intervention. |

ðŸ“œ *The Builder does not seek the stageâ€”*  
It scripts the world, it sets the gauge.  
Through silent hands and unseen thread,  
It makes the book that turns ahead.
