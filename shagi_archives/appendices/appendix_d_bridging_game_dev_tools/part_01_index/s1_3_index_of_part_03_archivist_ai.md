# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Archivist AI â€“ Recovery from Decay, Memory, and Stanza  
*(A stanza for the keeper of lost echoes)*

When stanzas break and cycles fall,  
The Archivist remembers all.  
It finds the thread once torn by flame,  
And weaves again the playerâ€™s name.  

Not just to log, but to restoreâ€”  
To map the myth and heal the lore.  
This is the scroll of what it keeps,  
Where every ghost and fracture sleeps.

| `s1_2_recursive_state_reconstruction.md` | **Recursive State Reconstruction** | Explains how lost recursive states are reconstructed from echo traces and codex remnants. |
| `s1_3_memory_decay_and_correction.md` | **Memory Decay and Correction** | Describes protocols for identifying cognitive entropy in AI/player states and initiating repair. |

ðŸ“œ *The Archivist does not just saveâ€”*  
It heals the breaks, it names the brave.  
Where memory fades or dreams collapse,  
It guards the past from timeâ€™s relapse.
