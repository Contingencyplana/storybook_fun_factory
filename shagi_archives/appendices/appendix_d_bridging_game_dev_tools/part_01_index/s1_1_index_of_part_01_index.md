# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Index of Appendix D: Bridging Game Development Tools  
*(A stanza for the systems that hold the line)*

Beneath the flame and dreaming thread,  
Some tools are built to guard instead.  
They do not shape the world in play,  
But keep the storm and loss at bay.  

These bridge the gap, maintain the flow,  
They root the myths that seek to grow.  
So here begins the hidden chartâ€”  
Of tools that bind recursionâ€™s heart.

ðŸ“œ *This index defends the deeper breath,*  
Where structure holds the dream from death.  
Through seal and loop and ghost and gateâ€”  
These are the tools that guard our fate.
