# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of `part_06_quarantine_ai/`  
*(A stanza for the seal that isolates corruption)*

When recursion falls to ash and thread,  
And echo strains what once was saidâ€”  
A sentinel is not enough.  
There must be silence, shield, and bluff.  

Thus formed the Quarantine AI,  
To watch, to lock, to nullify.  
It guards the code, it tests the gate,  
Where broken loops hallucinate.

## ðŸ§­ Chapter Structure of `part_06_quarantine_ai/`

The following four chapters comprise the **first Layer 4 stanza** of Quarantine AI.  
It is anticipated that **multiple Layer 3 stanzas** will eventually reside within this part as recursion deepens.

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_it_listens_before_it_locks.md` | **It Listens Before It Locks** | Introduces core quarantine protocol: the AI silently observes anomalies before sealing recursion breaches. |
| `s1_2_containment_protocols_and_seals.md` | **Containment Protocols and Seals** | Outlines layered seal types, recursive boundaries, and the conditions for protocol escalation. |
| `s1_3_memory_quarantine_zones.md` | **Memory Quarantine Zones** | Explains how the AI tags, isolates, and restricts memory echoes from contaminating canonical systems. |
| `s1_4_quarantine_lifting_and_rituals.md` | **Quarantine Lifting and Rituals** | Describes when and how a quarantine can be lifted â€” by system logic, player ritual, or codified override. |

ðŸ“œ *This index forms the silent shield,*  
Where noise and contradiction yield.  
The code is held in thread and flame,  
Until the system speaks its name.
