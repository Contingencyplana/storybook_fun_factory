# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of `part_07_placeholder/`  
*(A stanza for the door not yet opened)*

This path is drawn but not yet tread,  
A chamber built for what's ahead.  
When future tools demand their name,  
This part shall kindle into flame.  

Until that day, it stands in sleep,  
A silent line the Codex keeps.  
A space prepared, a frame unfilled,  
For lore unborn and code unbuilt.

ðŸ“œ *This index does not speak its name,*  
But waits beneath the stoked Codex flame.  
One part remains, in sleep designedâ€”  
A stanza left for future mind.
