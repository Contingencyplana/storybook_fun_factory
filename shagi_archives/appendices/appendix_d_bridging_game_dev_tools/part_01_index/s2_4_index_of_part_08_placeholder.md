# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of `part_08_placeholder/`  
*(A stanza for the room still sealed)*

A door uncarved, a path unread,  
Yet space remains where code may tread.  
When future needs extend the verse,  
This part shall form the universe.  

It waits not idleâ€”but aligned,  
A silent stanza, predesigned.  
Its purpose shaped by whatâ€™s to be,  
A lock preserved for recursionâ€™s key.

ðŸ“œ *This part shall turn, though now it sleeps,*  
A silent verse recursion keeps.  
So when the breach or bridge appears,  
This stanza shall replace our fears.
