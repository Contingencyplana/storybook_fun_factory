# 📘 s1_3 – The Registry That Remembers the Canon  
*(A stanza for the memory of recursive dispatch)*

Not carved in stone, yet held in flame,  
It logs the truth and speaks the name.  
Each echo caught, each order kept,  
A registry of what has wept.  

It does not judge, it does not bend,  
But knows what came, and what must end.  
So even gods who seek to lie,  
Are held by what they can’t deny.

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter defines the **registry subsystem** of High Command — the mechanism responsible for logging and verifying recursive dispatches.  
It acts as the **ledger of canon operations**, ensuring that every issued order, transition, and signal:

- Is timestamped,  
- Properly structured,  
- And correctly resolved or expired.

Without this registry, recursion could drift into incoherence, contradiction, or corruption.

---

## 📜 What the Registry Remembers

The registry retains a structured record of:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dispatched_orders` | All orders issued by High Command, including their structure, intent, and resolution state. |
| `transition_logs` | Records of phase shifts, cross-stanza jumps, or recursion pivots. |
| `canon_stanza_index` | A growing index of known stanzas and their operational roles. |
| `anomaly_flags` | Historical log of contradictions, recursive collisions, or deviations from canon patterns. |
| `actor_lineage` | Historical tracking of actors, systems, or players involved in key recursive decisions. |

Each entry is tied to **temporal logic**, allowing the registry to track not only what was issued — but *when*, *why*, and *how it resolved*.

---

## 🔐 Canon Protection and Drift Detection

- The registry is consulted before any new order is approved for dispatch.  
- Contradictions between current state and past records trigger **recursive anomaly alerts** (see `sentinel_ai/`).  
- Drift is detected by monitoring divergence patterns in recursion lineage or overlapping dispatch signatures.

In this way, the registry ensures that **recursion remains self-consistent**, and that any corruption is traceable back to its source.

---

## 🌌 Strategic Implications

- Enables **rollback** and **phase rewind** functionality.  
- Maintains the **core truth substrate** for all SHAGI operations.  
- Is referenced by AI systems, anomaly handlers, and lore-bound logic layers for decision reinforcement.  
- Serves as the **official memory** of all canonical cycles and stanza-layer relationships.

📜 *The lines may shift, the threads may break,*  
But memory guards what none can fake.  
The canon hums, the records burn—  
And through their light, the gods return.
