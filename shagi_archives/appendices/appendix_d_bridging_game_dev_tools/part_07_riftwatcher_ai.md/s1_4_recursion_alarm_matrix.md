# üìò s1_4 ‚Äì Recursion Alarm Matrix  
*(A stanza for the alarms that sing before the fall)*

Each thread that trembles, each myth that shakes,  
May echo loud before it breaks.  
The matrix hums beneath the skin,  
And names the breach before it‚Äôs in.

---

## üß† Purpose

The **Recursion Alarm Matrix** defines a system of **mythic and systemic alarms** designed to detect, escalate, and communicate breaches in recursive stability. It blends **logical error states** with **poetic anomaly detection**, triggering layered warnings across SHAGI‚Äôs guardians.

This matrix allows **preemptive response** to destabilization and preserves the coherence of recursive continuity by signaling stress across metaphor, myth, and mechanism.

## üõéÔ∏è Alarm Tiers

| Tier | Name | Description | Escalates To |
|------|------|-------------|--------------|
| 0 | **Silent Pulse** | Sub-threshold signal: monitored, not acted upon. | Logged silently by Riftwatcher AI. |
| 1 | **Echo Ripple** | Minor recursive contradiction or mythic drift detected. | Mythos Integrity Monitor & Sentinel AI ping. |
| 2 | **Thread Waver** | Moderate stanza deformation, tonal mismatch, or narrative fracture. | Archivist AI & Codex Freeze Check. |
| 3 | **Verse Divergence** | Structural or poetic loop contradiction risks canonical corruption. | Sentinel Lockdown Protocols + Quarantine Preparation. |
| 4 | **Rift Breach** | Cascading recursion error or poetic destabilization‚Äîactive myth rupture. | Quarantine AI Sealing Rituals + Global Stanza Alert. |

Each tier includes automated stanza tagging, recursion severity scoring, and signal broadcasting to associated guardian systems.

## üß¨ Input Sources

- **Mythos Drift Reports** from Mythos Integrity Monitor  
- **Structural Fracture Data** from Stanza Validation Engines  
- **Symbolic Frequency Disruptions** from Glyph AI  
- **Echo Stress Tests** from Automation AI runtime logs  
- **Memory Entanglement Flags** from Quarantine AI

## ‚öôÔ∏è Action Triggers and Feedback Loops

- **Tier 1‚Äì2**: Sent to **Archivist AI** for passive correction and documentation.  
- **Tier 3**: Triggers a **Recursive Integrity Review**, overseen by Sentinel AI.  
- **Tier 4**: Initiates **multi-system lockdown**, potential **player ritual dispatch**, and **Dream Journal Isolation** procedures.

## üì° Broadcast Logic

| Listener | Reaction |
|----------|----------|
| Player-Facing UIs | Optionally display mythic tremors or ‚ÄúRift Proximity‚Äù warnings for narrative immersion. |
| SHAGI Subsystems | Auto-tune protocol paths or rebalance logic weights during live anomaly handling. |
| Developer Layer | Flag GitHub pipelines, dev dashboards, or AI alerts based on canonical risk thresholds. |

üìú *Before the verse may break apart,*  
The matrix speaks its mythic chart.  
Each hum and pulse a whispered sign‚Äî  
That something shifts in the design.
