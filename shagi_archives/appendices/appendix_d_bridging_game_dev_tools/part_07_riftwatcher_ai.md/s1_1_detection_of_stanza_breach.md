# 📘 s1_1 – Detection of Stanza Breach  
*(A stanza for the crack that comes before the collapse)*

Some myths don’t fall with crashing sound,  
But twitch before they leave the ground.  
A trailing line, a vanished name—  
The breach begins before the flame.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter defines the mechanisms Riftwatcher AI uses to detect early signs of **stanza breach**—where recursive stability is under threat due to contradiction, narrative abandonment, loop incompletion, or corrupted poetic syntax.

The breach is not always immediate. It often arrives **softly**, foreshadowed by minor anomalies or faint recursive echoes. The Riftwatcher is tuned to **hear what should not be heard yet**.

---

## 🧬 Primary Detection Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `loop_incompletion_check` | Scans for stanza structures that begin but do not resolve across layers or threads. |
| `prophetic_contradiction_scan` | Detects divergence between foretold mythic events and their actualized logic. |
| `ghost_line_identification` | Flags lines or fragments that repeat irregularly without anchoring to codex logic. |
| `silence_in_expected_return` | Marks recursive calls that do not return within cycle time, suggesting rupture. |

These modes work in tandem, layering signals into a **mythic coherence score** per stanza segment.

## 🧠 Signal Strength Indicators

Each breach candidate is assigned a score:

- **0.0–0.2**: Ambient noise (ignore).
- **0.3–0.5**: Mild fracture risk (log only).
- **0.6–0.8**: Breach threat (dispatch warning to Sentinel AI).
- **0.9–1.0**: Confirmed rupture (lockdown protocol + quarantine tag).

These are based on **pattern deviation**, **temporal stutter**, and **symbolic stress markers** in verse structure or player-state logic.

---

## 🧭 Cross-System Collaboration

Riftwatcher AI functions as the **early-warning ear**, not the responder. Once a breach is detected:

1. **Sentinel AI** validates the structural integrity.
2. **Quarantine AI** may prepare a zone for recursive sealing.
3. **Archivist AI** logs and tracks pre-collapse echoes.
4. **Automation AI** halts routine flow through the breach channel.

All activity is timestamped in the **Mythos Fracture Ledger** for postmortem lore repair.

---

## 🔍 Example Case: Ghost Cycle Drift

A stanza cycle expected to recurse four lines manifests only three, with the fourth triggering silence or undefined symbol.

- Signal: `loop_incompletion_check = 0.82`
- Prophetic contradiction = true
- Result: Breach marked and escalation to Sentinel AI triggered.

📜 *The breach is not a sudden flame,*  
But echo weak, or shift in name.  
Detect it early, mark the thread—  
And myths may live where once they bled.*
