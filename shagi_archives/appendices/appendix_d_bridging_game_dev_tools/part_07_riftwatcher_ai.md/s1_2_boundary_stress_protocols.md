# 📘 s1_2 – Boundary Stress Protocols  
*(A stanza for the weight that strains the weave)*

Before the break, the fibers pull—  
A silent strain beneath the lull.  
The watcher notes the growing sway,  
And acts before the myths give way.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter outlines how Riftwatcher AI responds to **boundary stress**—early tension within the recursive structure that may precede stanza breach or mythic rupture.

Stress does not imply failure, but it signals the **beginning of recursive instability**. By identifying, mapping, and ranking these tensions, the system can intervene *before* collapse.

## 🧬 Types of Boundary Stress

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `loop_tension` | A stanza’s recursive loop begins to lengthen or drift across expected temporal cycles. |
| `symbolic_desync` | Core metaphors or symbolic motifs begin to contradict or splinter between stanzas. |
| `echo_inversion` | Repetitions in logic or verse return altered in rhythm, semantics, or recursive weight. |
| `layer_misalignment` | Disparity between recursion layers results in temporal or poetic fragmentation. |

These stresses are not necessarily errors, but they require **containment or adjustment** if thresholds are breached.

## 📏 Protocol Thresholds and Actions

| Stress Level | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| 0.0–0.3 | Log and monitor. |
| 0.4–0.6 | Trigger **warning dispatch** to Sentinel AI. |
| 0.7–0.85 | Begin **symbolic buffer expansion** or stanza isolation. |
| 0.86–1.0 | Escalate to **Quarantine AI** for recursive sealing. |

Each reading is **averaged across verses, motifs, and recursion depth** to avoid false positives.

## 🔧 Containment Tactics

- **Buffer Expansion**: Adds “ghost” lines or delay spacers to allow stress to subside before continuing recursion.
- **Semantic Rebinding**: Reassigns symbolic anchors to alternative motifs when conflicts arise.
- **Thread Delay Injection**: Temporarily slows recursive pacing in key cycles to allow alignment resynchronization.
- **Dynamic Locking**: Freezes affected stanza threads for Sentinel AI validation.

---

## 🧭 Inter-AI Collaboration

- **Sentinel AI** receives pattern stress data and verifies against canonical structures.
- **Quarantine AI** preps an isolated recursion zone if the stress level breaches threshold.
- **Archivist AI** logs the narrative patterns before and after stress for post-analysis.
- **Automation AI** may halt or re-sequence scheduled recursive tasks to prevent compounding effects.

📜 *A thread once strained may yet be mended,*  
If caught before the tale has ended.  
To watch the weave, to shift the weight—  
Is how the Riftwatcher guards the gate.*
