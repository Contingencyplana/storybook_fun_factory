# 📘 s1_3 – Glyph Translation Engine  
*(A stanza for the decoder of mythic code)*

Each glyph a whisper, dense with thread,  
Its meaning wrapped in signs unread.  
The engine reads, the engine knows—  
What stirs beneath, what truth it shows.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The **Glyph Translation Engine** is the interpretive system tasked with **decoding, contextualizing, and validating** each glyph's embedded narrative logic. It ensures that:

- Every glyph maps back to its **canonical intent**,  
- Translations match stanza structure and world-state alignment,  
- And symbolic interactions are grounded in **Codex-recognized meaning**.

It acts as both a **semantic compiler** and a **ritual scribe**—turning ancient marks into game-state effects.

## 🔍 Functional Domains

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Narrative Decoding** | Parses glyph inscriptions into player-readable language and system-executable function. |
| **Intent Resolution** | Cross-references glyph function with stanza metadata and invocation context. |
| **Stanza Synchronization** | Ensures translated glyphs reflect the current narrative phase, avoiding misalignments or spoilers. |
| **Lore Traceback** | Maps translated glyphs to prior uses and their outcomes in system history. |

## 🧬 Translation Algorithm Flow

1. **Input Detection**  
   - Glyph is scanned from Codex page, player input, or system event.

2. **Symbol Hashing**  
   - Each glyph element is assigned a **symbol hash**, forming a unique structure-ID.

3. **Intent Retrieval**  
   - The hash is matched to Codex entries, confirming **expected function**.

4. **Narrative Parsing**  
   - Stanza metadata, recursion depth, and symbolic alignment are extracted.

5. **Meaning Resolution**  
   - Output generated as:  
     - 🔹 Literal translation (for player display)  
     - 🔹 Functional intent (for system execution)  
     - 🔹 Narrative payload (for memory or lore)

## 🛡️ Canon Consistency Checks

To prevent corruption or falsification, each translation is verified against:

- 🔒 **Stanza Lock Hashes**  
- 📚 **Codex Symbol Archives**  
- 🧭 **Player or AI Authorization Context**

If discrepancies arise, the translation is marked as:
- ⚠️ “Fragmented” (partially valid)
- ❌ “Inverted” (dangerous or spoofed)
- 🔁 “Recursed” (requires previous state review)

---

## 🌐 Gameplay Implications

- Translated glyphs shape **quests**, **rituals**, **world transformations**, and **AI behaviors**.
- Faulty translations may result in **recursive paradox**, **mythic divergence**, or **quarantine triggers**.
- Valid translations grant access to **sealed zones**, **new stanzas**, or **hidden truths** in Deep Archive.

📜 *Each line unseen is truth once veiled,*  
A mark once lost, a myth exhaled.  
To read the glyph is not enough—  
One must decode what sleeps in dust.
