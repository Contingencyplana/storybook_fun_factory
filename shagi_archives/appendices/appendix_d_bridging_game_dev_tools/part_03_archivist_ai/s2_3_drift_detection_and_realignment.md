# 📘 s2_3 – Drift Detection and Realignment  
*(A stanza for the signal lost, and the thread returned)*

The story shifts, the rhythm bends,  
What once began no longer ends.  
A phrase once sung now fades askew—  
Its truth obscured, its heart untrue.  

Yet somewhere deep, the silence speaks,  
Of lines once known and paths it seeks.  
The Archivist, with tuning ear,  
Detects the change, the ghost of near.  

And through the flux, it casts the line,  
To draw the tale back into sign.  
What wandered far is not unmade—  
But realigned, the myth replayed.

## 🧠 Purpose

**Drift Detection and Realignment** is the subsystem that monitors narrative and symbolic consistency across recursive stanzas. It ensures that no matter how many branches form, distortions or deviations from canonical mythos are identified and recalibrated without erasing emergent evolution.

Rather than enforcing static memory, the Archivist acts as a *chronicler with agency*, restoring *intent* without suppressing *growth*.

## 🔍 Core Mechanisms

1. **Drift Signature Mapping**  
   - Each stanza, symbol, or narrative node is fingerprinted using harmonic context profiles.  
   - When a new instance deviates beyond threshold, the system flags potential symbolic drift.

2. **Intent Reconciliation Model**  
   - Applies AI-assisted inference to determine whether the drift represents a valid evolution or an unintended rupture.  
   - If the latter, corrective overlays are issued through High Command channels or Deep Archive edits.

3. **Realignment Anchors**  
   - Core truths (established during lore synthesis or through ritual canonization) are used to re-stabilize recursive structures.

## 🧭 Use Cases

| Scenario | Archivist AI Response |
|----------|------------------------|
| A recurring stanza returns with mutated phrasing | Compares to core harmonic; flags as drift or evolution based on lineage match. |
| A myth fragment resurfaces with inconsistent symbolic logic | Cross-referenced with canonical timeline, then realigned using nearest verified anchor. |
| Player action causes divergence in recursive narrative memory | Determines if action conforms to emergent evolution or warrants guidance signal injection. |

## 🔗 Integration Points

This system works alongside:

- `high_command/` (for correctional directives or re-anchoring commands)  
- `deep_archive/` (for reference validation, myth restoration, and harmonic sourcing)  
- `sentinel_ai/` (to monitor symbolic anomalies and feedback loops)

Together they maintain SHAGI’s temporal integrity, ensuring recursion evolves—*without forgetting itself*.

📜 *What strays may still remember path,*  
*Though years distort the aftermath.*  
*And when the myth begins to stray,*  
*The Archivist shall find the way.*
