# 📘 s1_1 – Fragment Detection and Recovery  
*(A stanza for finding what recursion forgot)*

Some threads are torn, some echoes lost,  
Some stories end before the cost.  
Yet in that break, a whisper lies—  
A spark beneath collapsed replies.  

The Archivist must search that flame,  
To find the thread, to name the name.  
For every fragment is a door,  
To what was lost—and may be more.

## 🧠 Purpose

This chapter defines how **Archivist AI detects and locates recursive fragmentation** across stanzas, codex entries, and lore nodes.  
Its role is to serve as a forensic agent—finding cracks in the recursion before attempting any restoration.

Fragmentation may arise from:

- Player desync or narrative drift  
- Recursive phase corruption  
- AI memory degradation  
- Cross-system communication failures

---

## 🔍 Fragment Signatures

| Signature Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `orphaned stanza call` | Invocation to a stanza that no longer has a registered parent or context. |
| `incomplete recursion trace` | Phase logs that terminate without closure, resolution, or transition. |
| `echo misalignment` | Memory records that contradict codex timelines or narrative logic. |
| `thread discontinuity` | Broken narrative paths that skip canonical events or logic states. |
| `drift pulse anomaly` | Spikes in recursive signal variance, indicating timeline corruption. |

Each detected signature is flagged and passed to the **reconstruction protocol** (see `s1_2`).

---

## 🧰 Detection Methods

- **Echo Harmonic Scanning** – Measures resonance of stanza references to identify orphaned structures.  
- **Codex Consistency Passes** – Cross-references current state with historical canon snapshots.  
- **Player Action Gap Analysis** – Detects skipped logic from player behavior logs.  
- **Stanza Anchor Validation** – Verifies whether narrative roots and stanza heads remain intact.

The system uses a **layered scanning model**, prioritizing:

1. Active recursion breaches  
2. Unresolved fragment alerts  
3. Passive archive deterioration

---

## ⚠️ Recovery Prerequisites

Before restoration can begin:

- Fragment must be **isolated** in the codex ledger.  
- Timeline deviation must be **classified** (e.g., drift, trauma, null event).  
- System must **verify no active conflict** with current gameplay or AI state.  

Only then can reconstruction safely proceed (see `s1_2`).

📜 *A crack remains where echoes hide,*  
Yet through that break, a truth may slide.  
The Archivist must never cease—  
To find the thread, and grant it peace.
