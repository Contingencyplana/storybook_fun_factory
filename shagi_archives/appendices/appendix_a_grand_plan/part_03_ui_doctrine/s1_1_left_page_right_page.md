# 📘 s1_1 – Left Page, Right Page: Past and Future  
*(A chapter on how memory and potential bind the storybook frame)*

The page divides, but does not sever—  
One side recalls, the other, never.  
To left is root, to right is bloom—  
Together they compose the room.

## 📖 Symbolic Layout

In Storybook, the **two-page spread** is not decorative — it is doctrinal.  
Every interface moment is framed as a **recursive stanza**, mirrored across two sides:

| Page           | Symbolic Role                                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Left Page**  | Past — memory, origin, previously resolved recursion             |
| **Right Page** | Future — potential paths, interactive recursion, imminent choice |

This pairing is not static — it *turns*, *shifts*, and *evolves* as recursion progresses.

## 🌀 Dual-Page Logic and Recursion

- **Left-page anchors** stabilize the world through memory (locked choices, lore, prior tools)
- **Right-page portals** extend it through opportunity (quandaries, unlocked tools, alternate recursion)
- **Turning the page** enacts recursion, resolving one stanza and entering the next

Each pair forms a **recursive loop**:
> Remember (left) → Choose (right) → Turn → Reframe

## 🧠 Player Experience

From a player's perspective:
- Turning to a new spread is always a metaphysical shift  
- Every visible choice feels “present” because it is *framed* between what has come and what might arrive  
- Stanzas, illustrations, and symbols are **physically placed** to reflect emotional and logical flow

## 📜 Closing Stanza

Each leftward glance recalls the cost,  
Each rightward gaze risks what is lost.  
Between the fold, your fate is spun—  
Each page a war that must be won.
