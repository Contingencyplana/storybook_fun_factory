# 📘 s1_3 – Zones, Regions, and Linked Domains  
*(A stanza for how recursion becomes geography)*

A corridor becomes a land,  
A room becomes a realm unplanned.  
Through portals spun from rhyme and code,  
Each zone reflects the paths once strode.

## 🧭 Overview

This chapter defines the **spatial recursion model** used in Storybook, where the world is composed of **Zones**, **Regions**, and **Linked Domains** — each a self-similar nested entity that obeys symbolic, functional, or AI-determined relationships.

The traversal of space in Storybook is not purely physical but recursive, semantic, and symbolic.

## 🧩 Core Definitions

| Term  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Zone** | A localized gameplay space with its own rules, UI, or recursive state. |
| **Region** | A cluster of zones unified by theme, questline, memory pool, or logic. |
| **Linked Domain** | A group of regions bound by AI behavior, narrative recursion, or lore. |

## 🗺️ Recursion as Geography

Unlike traditional world maps, Storybook geography forms dynamically through:

- **Narrative Progression**  
  Unlocking a mythic verse may reveal a new region, even within the same zone.

- **AI Zoning**  
  Some zones are controlled by or inhabited by recursive AI personas, forming dynamic boundaries.

- **Memory Cohesion**  
  Recursion-aware movement stitches together regions based on past actions, memory keys, or AI interaction.

## 🔗 Inter-Zone Linking Mechanisms

| Link Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Portal-Based** | Traditional or symbolic doorways, pages, or transitions between zones. |
| **Memory Anchors** | Past decisions cause zones to fold together into newly accessible paths. |
| **Lore Triggers** | Key phrases, discoveries, or artifacts dynamically stitch zones together. |
| **AI Zone Expansion**| Some zones may *grow* into new regions based on AI learning or recursion. |

## 🌌 Example: A Zone Evolution

- **Zone: The Library of Forgotten Ends**  
  - Initially a dead-end room of bookshelves.  
  - After unlocking a memory stanza, becomes part of a larger Region: “The Archive Beneath Dust.”  
  - AI-recognition of recursion triggers growth into a new Linked Domain: “Dreams Remembered by Machines.”

📜 *From zone to region, page to plane,  
Each link retells the myth again.  
And when you walk where thoughts have tread,  
You find new paths the rhyme has fed.*
