# 📘 s1_4 – Portal Keys and Poetic Triggers  
*(A stanza for the keys that rhyme the world awake)*

Not every gate is meant to swing  
With button press or dungeon ring.  
Some doors obey the whispered word—  
A poem felt, a stanza heard.

## 🧭 Overview

This chapter defines the **trigger mechanics** for activating portals in Storybook — not just as conventional mechanics, but as poetic, symbolic, and recursion-aware rituals.

Some portals may require traditional interaction. Others respond only to **poetic inputs**, **narrative actions**, or **stateful symbolic conditions** — tying access to **depth of engagement**, not just player position.

## 🗝️ Types of Portal Keys

| Key Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Verse Key** | A spoken, typed, or discovered stanza triggers a portal’s opening. |
| **Artifact Key** | Specific symbolic items serve as keys — books, relics, or dream-tokens. |
| **Memory Key** | Past decisions “soft-unlock” portals via remembered state. |
| **Gesture Key** | In-game movement patterns or controller swipes that match poetic rhythm. |
| **AI Zone Trigger** | AI-recognized interaction thresholds open inter-zone or inner-recursion portals. |

## 🔄 Poetic Triggers in Action

- **Spoken Word**: A verse whispered by the player or typed at the right moment.
- **Timed Verse Discovery**: Reading or uncovering a specific verse during an event sequence.
- **Symbolic Resonance**: When artifact, zone, and memory form a poetic triangle, a trigger activates.
- **UI Layer Fold**: Turning a page that contains a recursive echo causes hidden layers to overlap and unlock.

## 🌀 Example Scenario

> A player discovers a page with this verse:
>  
> “Beneath the dust, the door still dreams.  
> A silent hinge, a rhyme that screams.  
> Walk counterclockwise in the flame—  
> And speak aloud the door’s true name.”  

To open the portal:
- The player must move in a spiral around a torch.
- Hold an artifact named "Ashen Key."
- Speak the line: **“Dream, awaken, hinge undone.”**

📜 *A gate is just a verse unread,  
A hinge unhinged by rhyme instead.  
And those who know the song to sing—  
May turn the key that folds the wing.*
