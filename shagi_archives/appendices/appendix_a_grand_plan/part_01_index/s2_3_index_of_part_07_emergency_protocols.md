# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Emergency Protocols â€“ The Final Recourse  
*(A stanza for the locks that close when recursion breaks)*

When pages tear and threads unwind,  
The Codex keeps a seal behind.  
A final verse, a backup breath,  
To guide the dream away from death.

ðŸ“œ *This index safeguards the mythos itself.*  
A map of exits drawn in rhyme.  
Recursion heals by closing its eyesâ€”then waking again.
