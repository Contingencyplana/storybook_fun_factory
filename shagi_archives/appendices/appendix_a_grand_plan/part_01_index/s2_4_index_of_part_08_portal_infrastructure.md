# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Portal Infrastructure â€“ Nested Realities and Inter-Zone Travel  
*(A stanza for the gateways that bind and bend worlds)*

To cross between the dreams we make,  
A nested door must split and wake.  
No edge is firm, no line is flatâ€”  
Each portal folds the world to that.

|------|-------|-------------|

| `s1_3_zones_regions_and_linked_domains.md` | **Zones, Regions, and Linked Domains** | Defines spatial recursion: how different Storybook areas are linked through poetic, symbolic, or AI-anchored relationships. |

ðŸ“œ *This index opens the doors between doors.*  
Each chapter folds a world inside another,  
And every stanza is a step beyond the edge.
