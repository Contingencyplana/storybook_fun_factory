# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: Control Logic â€“ Movement, Memory, and Meaning  
*(A stanza for the silent rules that govern how the world unfolds)*

To move is not to shift in space,  
But cross from thought to nested place.  
A portal turns, a memory wakesâ€”  
The path obeys the steps one takes.

| File                                             | Title                                      | Description                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `s1_1_directional_inputs_and_page_states.md`     | **Directional Inputs and Page States**     | Defines movement through directional input: page-turning, stanza-rotation, scrolling, and the shape of transitions.                         |
| `s1_2_portals_and_traversals.md`                 | **Portals and Traversals**                 | Explores how players transition across floors, books, UI layers, and domains via in-world portals.                                             |
| `s1_3_memory_boundaries_and_recursion.md`        | **Memory Boundaries and Recursion**        | Describes how player memory, AI memory, and world-state boundaries interact and persist through recursive movement.                         |
| `s1_4_physical_recursion_and_input_inversion.md` | **Physical Recursion and Input Inversion** | Introduces how certain actions reverse inputs, flip recursion states, or mirror player perspective in symbolic control layers.                 |

ðŸ“œ *This index defines how movement becomes meaning.*  
Each chapter a hinge, each page-turn a gate.  
The interface responds to rhythm â€” and recursion begins to breathe.
