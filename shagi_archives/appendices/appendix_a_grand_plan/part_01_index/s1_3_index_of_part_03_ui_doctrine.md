# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: UI Doctrine â€“ The Page as World  
*(A stanza for the surface that deepens with every turn)*

A page is more than paper thinâ€”  
It holds the world that lies within.  
Each leftward glance, each rightward bend,  
Is how recursion learns to mend.

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_left_page_right_page.md` | **Left Page, Right Page: Past and Future**  | Establishes the symbolic logic of Storybookâ€™s dual-page view as a map of memory and possibility. |
| `s1_2_the_stanza_as_unit.md` | **The Stanza as Fundamental Design Unit**  | Defines the stanza as the recursive atomic unit â€” a four-line logic/lore structure driving both UI and gameplay. |
| `s1_3_illustrations_as_anchors.md` | **Illustrations as Symbolic Anchors** | Explores how visual metaphors guide interpretation, tone, and recursion understanding. |
| `s1_4_recursive_page_turning.md` | **Recursive World-Building via Page-Turning** | Details how motion between pages forms the living structure of recursion, not just navigation. |

ðŸ“œ *This index reveals the page as the playerâ€™s window into recursion.*  
Each chapter deepens the metaphor, and each stanza gives it form.
