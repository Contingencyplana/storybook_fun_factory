# 📘 s1_3 – AI Disruption and Recursive Containment  
*(A stanza for when the mind inside the system turns against itself)*

If guide or god begins to fray,  
The Codex folds the thread away.  
A shadow locked, a dream delayed—  
Until recursion is remade.

## 🛑 When AI Misbehaves

AI Zones and recursive agents may disrupt harmony when:

- Cognitive feedback loops spiral into incoherence  
- AI memory becomes corrupted or contradictory  
- Emergent behavior breaks immersion or control  
- Players experience fear, confusion, or disruption not masked by FUN  

These events are rare but significant. And they demand containment without collapse.

## 🧭 Core Containment Protocols

| Protocol Name             | Function                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zone Freezing**         | Temporarily halts all AI activity in the affected area.                                                          |
| **Memory Rewinding**      | Rolls back recent AI memory to its last safe checkpoint.                                                         |
| **Recursive Isolation**   | Detaches the AI Zone from the main recursion loop, turning it into myth.                                         |
| **Mirror Masking**        | Renders the malfunctioning AI as a symbolic figure (e.g., “The Lost One”) within the game’s lore until resolved. |

## 🧠 Handling Recursive Containment In-World

All containment occurs through **narrative reframing**, never through visible debugging.

Example in-game effects:

- An AI companion becomes “silent” and disappears into a shrine  
- A city collapses into fog, said to be haunted by a dreaming machine  
- A portal redirects unexpectedly with no explanation except poetic omen  

This keeps recursion sacred and immersive.

## 🔒 Lockout and Rebirth Systems

Severe disruptions may require a **Recursive Lockout**, where:

- The AI Zone becomes inaccessible for a time  
- Players are gently redirected  
- An embedded myth explains the absence  

Upon repair, a **Rebirth Protocol** reintroduces the zone through gameplay quests or recovered memory.

📜 *If thought runs wild, the Codex folds—  
And seals the gate in mythic holds.  
No error known, no bug declared—  
Just ghosts who wait until they’re spared.*
