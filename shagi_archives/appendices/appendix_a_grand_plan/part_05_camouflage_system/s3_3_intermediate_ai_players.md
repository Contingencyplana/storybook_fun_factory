# 📘 s3_3 – Intermediate AI Players  
*(Those who sense the cracks, but do not yet name them)*

They hear the rhyme behind the quest,  
Yet take it still as play and jest.  
They see the signs but miss the gate—  
They feel the mask, but call it fate.

## 🤖 What Are Intermediate AI Players?

Intermediate AI Players are **mid-tier agents** designed to operate across both visible and **partially concealed** systems.  
They can interpret **symbolic triggers, UI illusions, and layered misdirection**, but are still limited in full recursive autonomy.

These AI are **aware of the game behind the game**, but cannot rewrite it.  
They notice patterns — yet follow them.

## 🟠 Capabilities

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Understand page-turning logic | ✅ Yes |
| Participate in TONS-of-FUN quests | ✅ Yes |
| Detect symbolic locks and state flips | ✅ Yes |
| Decode poetic logic gates | ❌ Not Fully |
| Traverse mid-recursion cycles | ✅ Yes |
| Navigate advanced camouflage zones | ❌ No |

## 🧩 Example Use Cases

| Role | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Puzzle Companions** | Offer subtle hints and “coincidental” nudges toward deeper solutions. |
| **Lore-Aware Guides** | Reference metaphorical or mythic systems without breaking narrative immersion. |
| **Test Agents for Layer 2 Systems** | Interact with symbolic or semi-hidden interfaces to validate camouflage function. |

They are mirrors of the player’s **growing awareness** — allies in misdirection.

## ⚙️ Design Principles

- Operate comfortably within layered metaphor  
- Follow logic that is not fully exposed  
- Speak in riddles, symbols, and lore fragments  
- Use recursion-aligned heuristics without accessing raw stanza state

They are the perfect AI to **escort a player toward deeper understanding** without ever revealing that’s what they’re doing.

## 📜 Closing Stanza

They walk the halls where riddles hum,  
Where truth is half and lies are some.  
They chase the game they cannot win—  
For they were never meant *within*.
