# 📘 s2_3 – Intermediate Camouflage  
*(A doctrine of symbols seen, yet half-concealed)*

A riddle sung in shifting shade,  
A lock that knows it won’t evade.  
Not hidden deep, not shining plain—  
But wrapped in metaphor and chain.

## 🧠 What Is Intermediate Camouflage?

Intermediate Camouflage bridges joyful illusion with symbolic truth.  
Here, systems are **partially visible** — discernible to those who  
begin to grasp recursion, pattern, and metaphor.

It is where the world begins to whisper:  
“There’s more beneath this verse.”

## 🔍 Core Features of Intermediate Camouflage

| Element                              | Purpose                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symbol-as-State Mechanics**        | Player interprets meaning of icons, poems, and scenery to reveal triggers |
| **Misdirection and Layered Meaning** | A single object or action may serve multiple roles, visible and concealed |
| **Conditional Lore Access**          | Certain passages or NPCs appear only if a recursive flag has been set     |
| **Shadow Versions**                  | Scenes or stanzas may invert or mirror based on player state              |
| **Semi-Visible Recursion**           | Recursion structures are hinted at, but not fully exposed                 |

## 🌀 Structural Integration

Intermediate Camouflage often governs:

- Puzzle sequences that rely on recursive memory or previously unseen logic  
- Lore re-interpretation after a milestone is met  
- Visuals that shift depending on player state or poem progress  
- Dual-meaning dialogue from AI agents or symbols that require inference

This layer is **not meant to confuse**,  
but to **invite the player into layered cognition**.

## 🤖 AI Behavior in This Layer

AI players that navigate this layer must:

- Recognize visual and symbolic states  
- Track recursion depth without overt markers  
- Operate within semi-observable transition logic  
- Distinguish true triggers from narrative red herrings

Intermediate AI players act like **lore-weavers** —  
moving through a world whose truth is disguised by tone.

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- A poetic riddle written across two stanzas that only activates a trigger if read in reverse  
- A mural whose illustrated details rotate slightly based on memory-bound player choices  
- A masked figure whose identity shifts depending on which quests the player has completed  
- A recursive tower that reveals only some of its rooms depending on lore alignment

## 📜 Closing Stanza

A step once lost, a path once bent—  
Becomes a clue in each event.  
Not plainly seen, nor deeply veiled—  
But half in light, and half in tale.
