# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Three Layers of Camouflage  
*(A table of recursion beneath the veil of fun)*

The mask is not a single thread,  
But layered soft on code and head.  
Three tiers conceal, three steps revealâ€”  
What only deeper play may feel.

To look is to see.  
To see is to unmaskâ€”but only through joy.*
