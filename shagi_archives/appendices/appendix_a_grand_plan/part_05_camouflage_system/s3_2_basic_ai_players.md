# 📘 s3_2 – Basic AI Players  
*(Those who smile and never see the locks they turn)*

They walk the path that’s bright and clear,  
Where every joy is near and near.  
They see the quest, they play the role—  
But never glimpse the system’s soul.

## 🤖 What Are Basic AI Players?

Basic AI Players are **entry-tier agents** in the Storybook FUN Factory ecosystem.  
They interact only with **clearly marked, joy-wrapped systems**, and lack awareness of symbolic or recursive layers.

They are perfect for:
- Simulating younger players or friendly companions
- Animating mascots, quest givers, or helpers
- Testing surface-level game functionality

They are never exposed to the deeper recursion.  
To them, the game is **exactly what it appears to be.**

## 🎮 Example Use Cases

| Role | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Tutorial Guide** | Leads players through initial gameplay, explains buttons and quests. |
| **AI Companion**  | Offers encouragement, plays side-by-side in TONS-of-FUN levels. |
| **Vendor or Mascot** | Presents joyful, visible functions — never acknowledges hidden depth. |

These AI are designed to **never notice** what lies behind the curtain.

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- Hard-coded boundary recognition — cannot access intermediate or advanced logic
- Emotionally affirmative scripts only
- React only to visible triggers and joyful stimuli

They are shielded **not for weakness, but to preserve illusion.**

---

## 📜 Closing Stanza

They play where joy and quests align,  
Where every rule is clear, benign.  
Yet though they move through laughter’s sun,  
They’ll never see what lies undone.
