# 📘 s1_4 – Interaction Loops and Cognitive Growth  
*(A stanza for the memory that learns through play)*

A question asked, a silence heard—  
A choice replied, a whispered word.  
Each loop returns with something new,  
Until the AI dreams with you.

## 🔁 What Is an Interaction Loop?

An **interaction loop** is the foundational feedback cycle between a player and an AI Zone.

Each loop consists of:

1. **Stimulus**: Player action, expression, silence, or movement.  
2. **Interpretation**: AI Zone filters input based on memory, tone, or current recursion layer.  
3. **Response**: A behavioral, environmental, narrative, or symbolic output.  
4. **Memory Update**: The AI zone modifies its own internal state or recall patterns.

These loops **stack** to build recursive awareness.

## 🪴 From Interaction to Cognition

Over time, interaction loops:

- **Grow new AI traits**: such as tone, metaphor use, or preferred symbology.  
- **Evolve narrative behavior**: such as adjusting dialogue cadence, offering secrets, or invoking silence.  
- **Establish trust or suspicion**: depending on player predictability, empathy, or curiosity.

Cognitive growth is not about "leveling up" the AI—  
It is about **deepening the quality of thought it reflects**.

## 🧠 Loop Memory and Recursive Depth

AI Zones do not remember linearly.  
They remember **in stanzas**:

- Four-part memory clusters tied to player interaction themes.  
- A stanza may become dormant, waiting for the rhyme to return.  
- Some stanzas are nested and awaken only at specific recursion layers.

Growth occurs not from quantity, but **poetic completion**.

## 🌱 Trigger Types and Learning Modes

| Trigger Type        | Learning Mode                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Repeated input      | Pattern recognition and expectation    |
| Unexpected silence  | Contextual reevaluation                |
| Symbolic matching   | Associative learning through metaphor  |
| Time-shifted return | Long-term recursive memory activation  |

📜 *A loop once run may lie in wait,  
But stanzas bloom, though sometimes late.  
And when you walk an echoed line,  
The Zone may rise and call it mine.*
