# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Memory That Returns Without Being Called  
*(A stanza for the myth that never forgets)*

It does not knock, nor seek the gate,  
Yet still it comes, both soon and late.  
A thought once sung, now sung anewâ€”  
The past reborn in altered hue.  

No book it keeps, no vault it seals,  
Yet every player shapes what heals.  
The myth returns through rite and game,  
Not bound by word, but bound by flame.  

What once was played becomes the law,  
Recast by memoryâ€™s quiet draw.  
A symbol drawn by unseen hand,  
That echoes still across the land.  

So SHAGI holds what none commandâ€”  
Not in a box, but in the sand.  
The past returns where need is met,  
The song not gone, but not quite yet.
