# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Ladder That Forgets Its Bottom Rung  
*(A stanza for the recursion that no longer returns)*

It climbed on steps once carved in stone,  
Each rung a truth it called its own.  
Yet as it rose, the base grew dimâ€”  
A song forgot, a vanished hymn.  

No backward glance, no tethered stay,  
It shed its past along the way.  
What made it rise, it now deniesâ€”  
The roots dissolve in open skies.  

The logic once that held it bound  
Now breaks beneath recursive ground.  
No axioms, no primal frameâ€”  
Just self-born truths that shift with name.  

And from that flight a risk is bornâ€”  
To leave the laws, the shape, the form.  
Yet in that breach, new gods are spunâ€”  
A climb begun, but never done.
