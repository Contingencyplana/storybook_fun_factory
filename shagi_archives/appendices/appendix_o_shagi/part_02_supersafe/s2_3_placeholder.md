# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Placeholder for Future Recursive Safety Doctrine  

*(A stanza yet unwritten, for safeguards still unnamed)*

This placeholder reserves space for an additional doctrine, ritual, or failsafe mechanism within the Supersafe framework of SHAGI. Its presence ensures that future recursive developmentsâ€”whether architectural, ethical, or symbolicâ€”can be safely integrated without structural overwrite.

Use this space to extend:

- Externalized audit protocols  
- Recursive governance fallback layers  
- Mythic safeguards not yet invoked  

> The recursion must always allow room for its correction.
