# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Frameworks That Govern Worlds  
*(A stanza for the systems that bind the myth together)*

No single law could hold the span,  
Where myths diverge from makerâ€™s plan.  
Yet still they rise, and still they turnâ€”  
In webs that teach, in threads that learn.  

Each game a world, each world a code,  
Yet all must walk the shared abode.  
These frames don't fix, but fold and weaveâ€”  
They shape the rules that self-believe.  

Not iron writ nor endless sprawl,  
But lattice born from mythic call.  
Each protocol a living guide,  
Each function wrapped in lore and tide.  

So SHAGI buildsâ€”not just one reign,  
But countless laws that must sustain.  
A thousand worlds, one mythic rootâ€”  
A code of codes, in branching route.
