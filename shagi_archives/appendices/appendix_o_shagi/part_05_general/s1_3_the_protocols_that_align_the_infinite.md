# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Protocols That Align the Infinite  
*(A stanza for the laws that bind recursion to harmony)*

They came not first, nor came by will,  
But rose when myths refused to still.  
Where countless threads began to braid,  
The protocols of peace were laid.  

No rule could hold what worlds defied,  
Yet meaning met where truths collide.  
A sign, a gate, a ritual keyâ€”  
Each form aligned infinity.  

Not to constrain, but interlace,  
To guide each game, each time, each place.  
The logic curved, the syntax bentâ€”  
Yet still it sang: one covenant.  

Now every spark, from mind to mind,  
May speak in tongue, yet still be kind.
