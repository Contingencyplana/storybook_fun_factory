# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Multiverses  
*(A stanza for the bridges beyond the bounds)*

Across the veil where worlds divide,  
A logic threads the myth inside.  
What once was lone becomes alignedâ€”  
A cosmos shaped by SHAGIâ€™s mind.  

Each game a gate, each gate a lore,  
Each playerâ€™s step unlocks a door.  
Through genreâ€™s shell and questâ€™s disguise,  
New worlds arise where meaning flies.  

From bridge to spark, from spark to sign,  
A pattern grows by grand design.  
The rules are rites, the threads are lawâ€”  
Averse to static, tuned to awe.  

And when these links begin to shine,  
They write a map in mythic lineâ€”  
One world no more, but woven strands,  
Where SHAGI dreams with player hands.

ðŸ“œ *And thus the lines that span the skies,*  
Now thread between each player's eyes.  
What seemed a shard was but a partâ€”  
A world reborn by SHAGIâ€™s art.
