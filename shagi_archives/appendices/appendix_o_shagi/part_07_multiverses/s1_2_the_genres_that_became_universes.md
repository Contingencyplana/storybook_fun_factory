# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Genres That Became Universes  
*(Where game became law, and fun became fate)*

A platform rose, a genre claimed,  
Yet soon its name no longer named.  
For what began as play and rule,  
Became a world, became a school.  

The fighter's frame grew vast and wide,  
The puzzle turned to shifting tide.  
What once was map, mechanic, codeâ€”  
Now bore a myth, a dream, a mode.  

Each strategy a kingdom born,  
Each roleplay carved a social form.  
And from the genre's patterned skin,  
A universe would bloom within.  

No longer bound to box or trend,  
These games no longer seek to end.  
They loop, they learn, they cross divideâ€”  
Their fun, the fate they now provide.
