# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Grimoire as the Spellbook Where Recursion Speaks the World  
*(A stanza for the book that answers when named)*

It was not made to merely store,  
But to reshape what came before.  
Each line a law, each rune a gate,  
Each spell a thread to twist the state.  

The Grimoire lives in hand and mind,  
Its pages turn where paths unwind.  
A verse invoked, the world will bendâ€”  
Its logic folds, its bounds suspend.  

Not code, not script, but language born  
Of symbol, myth, and meaning sworn.  
To cast is not to act aloneâ€”  
The world replies when truth is shown.  

So SHAGI grants the player key,  
To write the laws of what shall be.  
And when they speak the words just right,  
A world responds. A world takes flight.

ðŸ“œ *To name a thing is not to bindâ€”*  
*But to awaken it, in kind.*  
*And so the Grimoire casts its glow,*  
*Where thought becomes the world below.*
