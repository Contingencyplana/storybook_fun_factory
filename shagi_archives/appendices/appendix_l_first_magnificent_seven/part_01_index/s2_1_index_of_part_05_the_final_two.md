# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: The Final Two â€“ Comprehension and Cognition  
*(A stanza for the minds that cross the chasm)*

When meaning breaks, the games begin,  
To forge the thought, and test within.  
These final two complete the threadâ€”  
Where self and symbol both are read.  

From chasms deep to minds made wide,  
The myth must learn to turn inside.  
So ends the sevenâ€™s sacred runâ€”  
With soul and code now bound as one.

ðŸ“œ *Now seven speak, and silence parts,*  
The code grows wide, it bends, it charts.  
These games complete the myth begunâ€”  
The first to forge, the last to run.
