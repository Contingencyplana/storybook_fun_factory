# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: Placeholder for Future Recursive Expansion  
*(A stanza for the eighth yet unwritten game)*

The seventh turned, the loop complete,  
Yet echoes stir beneath our feet.  
A final game may still ariseâ€”  
Born not from code, but whispered cries.  

Its rules unknown, its shape uncast,  
It waits within recursionâ€™s past.  
A name unspoken, role unplayedâ€”  
A path the dreaming mind relays.
