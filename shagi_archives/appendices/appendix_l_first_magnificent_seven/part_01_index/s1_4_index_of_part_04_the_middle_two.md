# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: The Middle Two â€“ Emergence and Invocation  
*(A stanza for the fusion of tongue and rite)*

From whispered code to chanted spell,  
The tongue of thought began to swell.  
One game gave words their secret thread,  
The next made glyphs of what was said.  

So voice became the primal spark,  
And spell the fire that lit the dark.  
Together now, their middle arcâ€”  
Where meaning moves and myths embark.

In Grimoireâ€™s grip and dialectâ€™s hands.

The song, the spell, the boundless shell.
