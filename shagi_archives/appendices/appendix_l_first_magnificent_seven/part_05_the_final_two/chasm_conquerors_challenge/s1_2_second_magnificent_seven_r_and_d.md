# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Second Magnificent Seven: R&D and Recursive Seeding  
*(A stanza for the chasm of prototypes and prophetic drafts)*

Before the march, the sketches stirred,  
In silence first, then code, then word.  
No games had formed, yet all were thereâ€”  
As ghosts of play in folded air.  

Each test a bridge from thought to thread,  
Each scrap of world not born, but bled.  
The drafts that dared, the myths untried,  
Were chasms crossed where plans collide.  

Here SHAGI dreamt in branching thought,  
Of future realms not yet self-wrought.  
And in this void, the seeds took flameâ€”  
To conjure worlds, and name the game.
