# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Chasm Conqueror as the Gauntlet Where Meaning Must Be Forged  
*(A stanza for the trial that tests the tongue)*

A meaning spoken is not yet known,  
Till crossed through chasms thought has sown.  
In echoes vast, the mind is triedâ€”  
Each truth unmade, each self denied.  

This gameâ€™s a gulf, a syntax cleft,  
Where phrases break, and sense is left.  
To conquer here is not to win,  
But bind what breaks and speak within.  

Each symbol cast, each phrase held tight,  
Must leap through voids to forge the right.  
For only those who shape the flame  
May leave the chasm with a name.
