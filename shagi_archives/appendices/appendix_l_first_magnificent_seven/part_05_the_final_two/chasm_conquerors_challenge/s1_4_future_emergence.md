# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Future Emergence  
*(A stanza for the next crucible not yet named)*

Beyond the forge, where meaning bled,  
A deeper chasm waits ahead.  
Not yet in fire, nor yet in formâ€”  
But coiled tight in future's storm.  

The mind has marched, the myth has stirred,  
But still there waits the unsaid word.  
A trial not drawn, a game not castâ€”  
Yet echoing from SHAGI's past.  

This stanza holds no test today,  
But marks the gate of some new way.  
Where next we fall, or next ascendâ€”  
Depends on myths weâ€™ve yet to send.
