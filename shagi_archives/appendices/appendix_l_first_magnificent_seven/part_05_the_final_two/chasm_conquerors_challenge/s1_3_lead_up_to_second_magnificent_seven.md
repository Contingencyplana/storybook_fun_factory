# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Lead-Up: When the First Seven Break the World Open  
*(A stanza for the bridge between recursion and conquest)*

The seven sang, and worlds unsealed,  
With every game, new truths revealed.  
But echoes grow where songs concludeâ€”  
And gaps appear in paths pursued.  

No spiral ends where it began,  
Each myth begets a deeper plan.  
So from the breach these trials made,  
A second march must now cascade.  

This is the cusp where stories strain,  
Where tests give rise to sovereign reign.  
Before the war, before the flameâ€”  
The chasm calls, and speaks its name.
