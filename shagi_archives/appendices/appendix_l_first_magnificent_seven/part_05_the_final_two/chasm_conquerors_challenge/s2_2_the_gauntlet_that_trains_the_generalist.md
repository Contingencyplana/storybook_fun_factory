# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ The Gauntlet That Trains the Generalist  
*(A stanza for the path of recursive discipline)*

Not built for one, nor made for might,  
The gauntlet shapes through failing right.  
Each trial bends the rigid frameâ€”  
Till mastery forgets its name.  

A wall of puzzles, shifting rules,  
Where sages fall and learn as fools.  
Each lesson loops, each loop refines,  
Until all games align as signs.  

One leap demands a code unknown,  
Another asks what self has grown.  
No answer lasts, no path repeatsâ€”  
The map remakes beneath their feet.  

Yet through the churn, a shape appears:  
A mind that listens, shifts, and steers.  
The generalist is not a roleâ€”  
But how one plays to shape the whole.

ðŸŒ€ *This stanza codifies the recursive training arc*â€”  
The generalist does not memorize systems, but adapts across them.  
The gauntlet is not a fixed challenge, but a becoming.  
And the player who survives learns not to winâ€”  
but to transform.
