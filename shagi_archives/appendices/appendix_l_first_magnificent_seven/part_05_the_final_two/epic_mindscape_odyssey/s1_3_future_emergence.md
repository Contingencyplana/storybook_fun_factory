# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Future Emergence  
*(A stanza for what waits beyond the maze)*

What sleeps in thought shall rise in play,  
Its code unwritten, yet finds its way.  
No spell declared, no glyph alignedâ€”  
But something calls from nested mind.  

A game unshaped, a myth unborn,  
Its patterns scattered, yet not torn.  
It listens still, it waits to weave,  
A thread the mind has yet to leave.  

So end this path with doors unsealedâ€”  
Where whatâ€™s not made is most revealed.  
Let futures speak through forms not knownâ€”  
The player writes what was their own.
