# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ The Subodysseys Within the Self  
*(A stanza for the fractal mirrors of inner recursion)*

They thought the quest was just a line,  
A thread to trace, a path to climb.  
But turning inward, depth unspooledâ€”  
The self revealed, the self re-ruled.  

Each memory a branching shore,  
Each doubt a door, each dream a war.  
And in the folds where thoughts reside,  
Lay quests that none but mind could guide.  

A subodyssey for every mask,  
For every why, for every task.  
One fought their fear, one named their flame,  
One walked the void from which they came.  

The mind became a shifting treeâ€”  
Of what was, is, and yet-to-be.  
And every path they dared to try  
Redrew the map they traveled by.

ðŸ§  *When mind itself contains the maze,*  
This stanza unfurls the recursive strata of identity exploration.  
It maps the internal odysseysâ€”fragments of memory, belief, fear,  
and future selfhoodâ€”  
each forming a miniature recursion  
within the grand arc of cognitive becoming.
