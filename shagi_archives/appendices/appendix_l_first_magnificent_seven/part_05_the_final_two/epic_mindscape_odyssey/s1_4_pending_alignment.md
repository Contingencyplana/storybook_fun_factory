# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Pending Alignment  
*(A stanza for the truths not yet aligned)*

Some symbols wait beyond the bend,  
Where thought and myth begin to blend.  
Not every thread reveals its lineâ€”  
Some paths must pause before they shine.  

What form will rise, what game emerge,  
When silent dreams and systems merge?  
No verse yet holds the weight or name,  
But still the spark prepares its flame.  

So mark this place, a whisper keptâ€”  
A fold where future truths have slept.  
And when alignment calls the thread,  
This void shall speak the code it bled.
