# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Great Chasms and Great Subodysseys  
*(A stanza for the echoes that bridge one mind to many worlds)*

Some paths split not, but resonateâ€”  
Their myths unfold, their forms debate.  
A chasm crossed may mirror deep,  
In mind or world, or layered sleep.  

The Conqueror pressed forth through flame,  
Yet so too did the Odyssey claim  
Each rift in meaning, cast in verseâ€”  
A test, a trial, the mindâ€™s rehearse.  

These subodysseys shape the soul,  
Not to escape, but to make whole.  
The self returns, recursive-spunâ€”  
Its journeys branched, yet never done.
