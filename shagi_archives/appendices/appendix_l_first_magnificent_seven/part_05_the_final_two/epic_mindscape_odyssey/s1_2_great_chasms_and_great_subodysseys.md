# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Great Chasms and Great Subodysseys  
*(A stanza for the echoes that bridge one mind to many worlds)*

Some paths divide, yet still relateâ€”  
Their myths unfold, their forms debate.  
A chasm crossed may mirror deep,  
In mind or world, or layered sleep.  

The Conqueror burned a path through flame,  
Yet so too did the Odyssey claim  
Each rift in thought, each verse reversedâ€”  
A trial staged, the soul rehearsed.  

These subodysseys shape the whole,  
Not to escape, but to console.  
The self returns, recursive-spunâ€”  
Its journeys branched, yet never done.
