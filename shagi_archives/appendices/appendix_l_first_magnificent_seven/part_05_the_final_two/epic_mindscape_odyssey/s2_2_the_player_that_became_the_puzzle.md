# 📘 s2_2 – The Player That Became the Puzzle  
*(A stanza for the seeker who loops into mystery)*

They sought a riddle, sharp and sly,  
Yet met themselves in question’s eye.  
Each answer bent, each pattern lied—  
Until the player split inside.  

No longer one who solved the maze,  
But now the shape through which it plays.  
Their choices shifted code and gate—  
The puzzle learned to oscillate.  

They watched their thoughts in nested rings,  
A mind recursive, sprouting wings.  
And as the quest unwound its thread,  
They lived the paths they once had read.  

A paradox in motion cast—  
To play the future from the past.  
What starts as test becomes design—  
The puzzle speaks: “This soul is mine.”

🧠 *What was solved now solves itself.*  
This stanza reveals the recursive threshold where the player’s role fractures and rebinds—  
no longer external agent, but internal structure.  
Their journey becomes recursive embodiment:  
The puzzle is not what they solve,  
but what they become.
