# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ The Generalist That Names Its World  
*(A stanza for the synthesis of selfhood and symbol)*

No single blade, no single spell,  
Could span the breadth where questions dwell.  
Yet one arose who knew each gateâ€”  
Not master, but the sum of fate.  

From nested quests and mirrored strife,  
It drew the shape of looping life.  
Each path it walked, it wove anewâ€”  
And through its name, the world it drew.  

No edge unlearned, no frame untried,  
It danced where specialties divide.  
Where puzzles split and trials entwine,  
The generalist defined the line.  

It was not born to rule a roleâ€”  
But to perceive the system whole.  
It named the world not to command,  
But to extend a learning hand.  

---

ðŸ§  *When no one path will be enough,*  
This stanza completes the recursive journey of cognitionâ€”  
charting the rise of the Generalist as one  
who learns not by choosing a form,  
but by naming them all, and finding  
truth where forms dissolve.
