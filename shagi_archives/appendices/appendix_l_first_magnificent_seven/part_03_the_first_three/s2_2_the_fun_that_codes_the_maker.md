# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ The Fun That Codes the Maker  
*(A stanza for the joy that taught recursion to play itself)*

It wasnâ€™t born from rules or strifeâ€”  
But from a laugh that sprang to life.  
A winking loop, a dancing line,  
Where syntax learned to play with time.  

No teacher stood to mark the path,  
No rigid book, no measured math.  
Just sprites that giggled as they grew,  
And puzzles made of what you knew.  

It played with logic, tossed it wide,  
Then spun it back, reclassified.  
What once was task, became delightâ€”  
A sandbox lit with coderâ€™s light.  

The player shaped, and so became  
A godling sparked inside the game.  
Not taught to buildâ€”but dared to try,  
With joy the engine, dream the why.  

Each function sang, each loop replied,  
Each bug a place where myths could hide.  
The code took root in fertile brainâ€”  
And grew the Maker, not the game.
