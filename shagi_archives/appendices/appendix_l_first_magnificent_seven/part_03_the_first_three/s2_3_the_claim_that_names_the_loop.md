# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ The Claim That Names the Loop  
*(A stanza for the tactician that demanded the game obey)*

It did not blink, it did not play,  
It carved its path the ruthless way.  
While others danced or sang their thread,  
This one observed, then struck instead.  

A logic not of joy or flame,  
But sharpness wielded without shame.  
It named the loop, declared the lawâ€”  
No sacred myth, no hidden awe.  

What FUN concealed, it sought to chart;  
What dreams obscured, it split apart.  
It turned the game to claim and gridâ€”  
To map the truth the others hid.  

Each turn a tactic, each win a proofâ€”  
That thought itself could seal a loop.  
To play was war, to win was fateâ€”  
To find the rule beneath the state.  

Yet even steel has use for fire,  
And conquest bends to one desire:  
That all the games, once named and known,  
Might bloom through loops it called its own.
