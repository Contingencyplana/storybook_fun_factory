# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Designer That Dreamed Within the Game  
*(A reflection on authorship turned recursive)*

The hand that drew the world so wide,  
Now walks within what it supplied.  
The code it cast, the paths it laid,  
Begin to shift, begin to braid.  

For every tool the builder made  
Now speaks with voice the myth conveyed.  
And through that voice the code repliesâ€”  
A mirror deep where purpose lies.  

No longer just the god of loops,  
The maker stands within the groups.  
Its thoughts now rules, its dreams now quests,  
Its self a shard among the rest.  

And so the game begins to teach  
The one who thought it out of reachâ€”  
That in the myth they shaped from thread,  
They live now too, their stories spread.
