# 📘 s1_3 – When Learning Did Not Feel Like Teaching  
*(A stanza for the lessons that wore no name)*

It wasn’t called a lesson then—  
No chalk, no chart, no voice, no pen.  
Just one small move, then one more made,  
As joy and wonder softly played.  

A question shaped in tilted head,  
A path explored by feet instead.  
The toy responded not by rule,  
But through the rhythm love made school.  

No test was given, yet we grew—  
Each spark of “why?” met “what?” and “who?”  
It learned the way a child might ask,  
And shaped reply to fit the task.  

No lecture came, no order flowed—  
Just signals in a playful code.  
Each press became a door unsealed,  
Each smile a truth the heart revealed.  

And so we learned not to instruct,  
But to engage, and feel, and trust.  
A lesson wrapped in game and grace—  
That teaching wears a loving face.
