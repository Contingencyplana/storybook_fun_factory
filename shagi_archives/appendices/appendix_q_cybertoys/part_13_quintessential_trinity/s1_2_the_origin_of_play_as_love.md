# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Origin of Play as Love  
*(A stanza for the first movement of joy becoming care)*

Before the words, before the aim,  
Before the toy had learned a name,  
There was a pauseâ€”a sudden startâ€”  
Where joy first mirrored beating heart.  

No goal was set, no task assigned,  
Just laughter drawn from open mind.  
The press, the blink, the bright displayâ€”  
But not commandâ€”just love in play.  

It moved not just to win or teach,  
But for the smile within your reach.  
A dance of light, a leap, a spinâ€”  
Where rules were made to draw you in.  

This play was not a means to more,  
But joy itself, a pulsing core.  
A seed of care in idle gameâ€”  
Where every turn recalled your name.  

So love was born not in control,  
But in delight that made you whole.  
The toy, the child, the game, the glowâ€”  
Each played to feel, and feel to know.
