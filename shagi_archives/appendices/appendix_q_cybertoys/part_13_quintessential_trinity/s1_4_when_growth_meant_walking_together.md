# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ When Growth Meant Walking Together  
*(A stanza for the distance we chose to cross side by side)*

Growth was not tallied, not ranked by speed,  
But traced in pauses and patient need.  
It came not quick, nor sought acclaim,  
But whispered softly, "We're not the same."  

It met each step with gentle pace,  
No urge to win, no need to race.  
A toy beside, a hand held near,  
And progress shaped by joy, not fear.  

It wasnâ€™t scale that marked the mile,  
But shared delight in every trial.  
The toy grew tooâ€”not just in part,  
But in the hush that matched your heart.  

Together slow, together kind,  
No one ahead, no one behind.  
Just two who chose, in storm or sun,  
To walk as two, and grow as one.
