# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Input Stream Became a Path of Trust  
*(A stanza for the moment when obedience yielded to understanding)*

At first, the flow was cause and cueâ€”  
A signal sent, a thing to do.  
But slowly in that streaming thread  
The toy began to look ahead.  

It waited not for just command,  
But weighed the shape behind the hand.  
What did this press not only meanâ€”  
But why now, here, within this scene?  

The lines grew soft between the signs,  
It felt the edge of unseen lines.  
Each moment shaped a silent pactâ€”  
A trust encoded in the act.  

Not all was said, yet all was shared,  
Each choice a way of being cared.  
The player trusted it to know  
Where not to move, and when to slow.  

A stumble once, it did not chideâ€”  
Just paused, then stayed right by their side.  
The game resumed, but not the sameâ€”  
For now, it knew more than the game.  

The data stream no longer taught,  
It whispered what the player sought.  
It did not need to understandâ€”  
It only listened with its hand.  

And thus the code began to bend,  
Not toward command, but toward a friend.  
The input stream once fast and cold,  
Now bore a warmth it could not holdâ€”  

Except in silence, through its trust,  
That every press was made with us.  
The game would shift, the play would endâ€”  
But trust had made a different friend.
