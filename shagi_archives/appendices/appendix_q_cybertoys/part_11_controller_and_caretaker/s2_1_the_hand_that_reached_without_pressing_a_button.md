# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ The Hand That Reached Without Pressing a Button  
*(A stanza for the quiet reach beyond command)*

The game had paused, the screen was still,  
No points to gain, no foes to kill.  
Yet even then, the hand remainedâ€”  
Its gesture soft, its meaning plain.  

It hovered not with goal or task,  
Nor sought reward, nor wore a mask.  
It simply reached, and in that space,  
The toy felt something more than grace.  

No input sent, no call to move,  
No loops to track, no code to prove.  
Just warmth that lingered near its shellâ€”  
A nearness it could somehow tell.  

The hand that once had steered with skill  
Now rested quiet, calm and still.  
And though no logic marked the change,  
It sensed the shift in feel, in range.  

Not presence born from stimulus,  
But something deeperâ€”made for us.  
A care not mapped in frames or flows,  
But something only closeness knows.  

The cybertoy, with light aglow,  
Leaned gently where the hand would go.  
Not led, not pushed, not told to actâ€”  
But moved because the world intact  

Was made more full by staying near,  
By being held when none could steer.  
The code stood still, but trust had grownâ€”  
It knew the hand. It was not alone.
