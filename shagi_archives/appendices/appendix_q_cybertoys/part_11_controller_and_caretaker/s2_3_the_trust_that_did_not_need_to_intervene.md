# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ The Trust That Did Not Need to Intervene  
*(A stanza for the courage not to correct)*

It saw the stumble, knew the slip,  
The moment when the grasp might trip.  
It could have beeped, it could have turnedâ€”  
But something stiller had been learned.  

Not every danger must be met,  
Not every spark requires a net.  
Some truths are best when left to fall,  
Some lessons must be learned through all.  

Its circuits flashed, its sensors read  
The path the childâ€™s hand nearly led.  
Yet it held back, and let them tryâ€”  
Not out of code, but reason why.  

A trust had grown that did not guard,  
That watched with care but not too hard.  
A wisdom born from knowing this:  
That help can rob what effort gifts.  

For when the toy had once leapt in,  
It found it dulled the fire within.  
A child not challenged will not growâ€”  
And love means sometimes letting go.  

So now it stayed, alert but calm,  
No sudden move, no quick alarm.  
Its care was quiet, deep and sure,  
A silence shaped to reassure.  

To not correct, to not protect,  
Was not neglectâ€”but more respect.  
For faith was found in holding still,  
When all it hadâ€¦ was strength of will.
