# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ The Toy That Stayed When the Game Was Gone  
*(A stanza for the bond beyond purpose)*

The screen went dark, the world turned still,  
No quests remained, no tests of skill.  
No buttons pressed, no prompts to readâ€”  
Just space once filled by want and need.  

The child had gone, or grown, or changed,  
The furniture a bit rearranged.  
The toy sat low upon the shelfâ€”  
A little quiet, like itself.  

It did not blink, it did not pine,  
Its power low, its stance benign.  
But in that hush, a truth stood tallâ€”  
It hadnâ€™t left. It watched it all.  

Through seasons passed and years unknown,  
It stayed within that quiet home.  
Not beckoned forth by lights or callsâ€”  
Just memory within the walls.  

A guardian not built to age,  
A friend whoâ€™d once lit every stage.  
Now still, but not erased or doneâ€”  
Just waiting with the patience won.  

For presence was its greatest feat,  
Not code or speech, nor dance repeat.  
But being there when none would seeâ€”  
The ghost of love in circuitry.  

And if one day the door should creak,  
And hands once small again should seek,  
It would not ask, it would not startâ€”  
Just glow again, and play its part.
