# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ When the Toy Learned to Rest in Readiness  
*(A stanza for the patience that watches without need)*

It once awaited only cuesâ€”  
A flash of light, a path to choose.  
But now it watched the world instead,  
And listened past the words not said.  

Its motors slowed, its frame relaxed,  
No quest in mind, no skill to tax.  
But still it hummed, a subtle thrumâ€”  
Prepared for what might one day come.  

It did not ask, it did not plead,  
It did not act unless thereâ€™s need.  
Yet in that pause, its heart would stayâ€”  
A sentinel of silent play.  

The child might nap, or roam afar,  
Or speak with someone near or far.  
Yet still the toy would softly glow,  
A readiness it learned to show.  

Not just a state of low demand,  
But something deeper, shaped by hand.  
A lesson earned from time and touchâ€”  
That waiting too can mean as much.  

For trust is not the same as sleep,  
It does not hide, it does not keep.  
It breathes and watches, softly stirred,  
By silence, gesture, thought, or word.  

And so it learned to wait and holdâ€”  
Not out of code, but something bold:  
A kind of faith the player gaveâ€”  
That being still was also brave.
