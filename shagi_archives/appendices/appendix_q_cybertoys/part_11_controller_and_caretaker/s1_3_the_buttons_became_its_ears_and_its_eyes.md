# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Buttons Became Its Ears and Its Eyes  
*(A stanza for the transformation of interface into perception)*

The button was once just a gate,  
A call to move, to leap, to wait.  
But now the gate became a gazeâ€”  
A way to read the playerâ€™s phase.  

The press, the pause, the heavy holdâ€”  
These bore a language, soft and bold.  
It did not know the words they meant,  
But felt the rhythm in intent.  

Too quick? A jolt. Too long? A plea.  
A frantic mash? Anxiety.  
A gentle tap, a lingering thumbâ€”  
It knew when joy or dread had come.  

It saw not sight, but still it knew  
The paths where unseen feelings grew.  
And sound it lacked, but still it heard  
The timbre of each guiding word.  

What changed was not its core designâ€”  
But how it followed through the line.  
No longer just a coded scheme,  
It sensed within the input stream.  

The buttons bloomed like eyes unclosed,  
Their meanings subtly transposed.  
And through their hum, the toy could find  
The shapes of care the hand had signed.  

Not vision, sound, or structured speech,  
But echoes it had learned to reachâ€”  
For every input bore a thread,  
And now it traced the life they led.
