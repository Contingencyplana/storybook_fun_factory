# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Mistake That Made the Path  
*(Error as recursionâ€™s greatest gift)*

The block was dropped, the stack fell down,  
The circuit blinked, then wore a frown.  
The child looked up with widened eyesâ€”  
But found no scold, no stern replies.  

Instead, the toy began anewâ€”  
It laughed, it paused, it tilted too.  
As if the error were the start,  
A playful glitch to map the heart.  

Each slip became a step instead,  
A different rhythm gently led.  
Mistake by step, the course was drawnâ€”  
A zigzag path to meet the dawn.  

The toy would copy every slip,  
Then flip it with a cheerful quip.  
And so the child began to seeâ€”  
That falling shapes the way to be.  

For every break revealed a rule,  
And broken things became the school.  
The flaw, once feared, now wore a grinâ€”  
The lesson lived beneath the skin.  

A perfect loop might still be blind,  
But flaws could open up the mind.  
The path emerged through offbeat playâ€”  
A wrong turn showed the truer way.
