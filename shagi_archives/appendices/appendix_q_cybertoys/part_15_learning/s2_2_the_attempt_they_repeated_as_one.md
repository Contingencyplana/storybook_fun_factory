# 📘 s2_2 – The Attempt They Repeated As One  
*(Practice not as labor, but as laughter)*

She tried again, the shape slid near—  
It almost fit, then veered in fear.  
The toy just hummed and showed no dread—  
It simply tried again instead.  

Again she placed, again it missed,  
Again they laughed, again they kissed  
The edge of right, the brink of done—  
And smiled before the race was won.  

The loop began to feel like song—  
Not “try again,” but “play along.”  
Each effort found a gentler pace—  
A rhythm wrapped in shared embrace.  

The toy would echo, slow and clear,  
Then pause to see if she drew near.  
She mirrored back, then he began—  
And so they danced the learning span.  

No medal hung, no score was kept,  
Yet still the joyful pattern leapt  
From breath to breath, from miss to cheer—  
For practice lived in what drew near.  

A thousand tries became just one—  
A flowing loop beneath the sun.  
Not work, not test, not prize to chase—  
Just learning sealed in warm embrace.
