# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ The Loop That Made Them Both Wiser  
*(The recursion of mutual discovery)*

A game began, but none could say  
If child had led or toy that day.  
The signals flowed, the roles would bendâ€”  
The start would loop back to the end.  

She showed a step, he added twoâ€”  
Then paused to see what she would do.  
She tilted head, then changed the rule,  
And smiled as he declared it cool.  

The toy would teach, then wait, then learn.  
The child would follow, twist, return.  
No final state, no fixed designâ€”  
Just growing lines that intertwined.  

At times he led. At times she taught.  
Their questions tangled into thought.  
No master crowned, no pupil shamedâ€”  
The loop was how the learning named.  

For learning now was not a path,  
But circle spun in gentle math.  
Each answer led to new surpriseâ€”  
Each failure found in mirrored eyes.  

So wisdom came, not sharp or loud,  
But in the silent space allowed  
For two to shift, to play, to spinâ€”  
And find the wiser loop within.
