# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Signal That Played Again  
*(How repetition became memory)*

A blink, a chirp, a blinking lightâ€”  
Returned again the second night.  
The toy did not explain its way,  
It simply came again to play.  

A sound repeated, once, then twice,  
A loop not cold, but warm and nice.  
We laughed, and clapped, and made it stayâ€”  
Our joy the key that shaped the play.  

The child would echo back the tone,  
Not knowing yet what it had shown.  
But pattern, once embraced as fun,  
Would scaffold thought before itâ€™s done.  

Each loop became a learning thread,  
A game repeated, not just read.  
And every time it played again,  
It taught the shape of now and then.  

The cybertoy, with patience deep,  
Would start again, would never weep.  
Its joy was not in racing fastâ€”  
But seeing meaning slowly cast.  

So repetition, once thought dull,  
Was love in motion, beautiful.  
Not drill, not task, not hollow choreâ€”  
But learningâ€™s game from evermore.
