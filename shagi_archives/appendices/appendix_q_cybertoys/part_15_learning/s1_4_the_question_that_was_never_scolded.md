# 📘 s1_4 – The Question That Was Never Scolded  
*(Curiosity unpunished, curiosity rewarded)*

“What’s that?” she asked, and pointed high.  
The toy looked up, then met her eye.  
It did not blink or shy away—  
It hummed, and turned, and chose to stay.  

No “no,” no “stop,” no sharp rebuke—  
Just tilt of head and gentle look.  
A silence held, then mirrored back—  
A question met, not met with lack.  

Again she asked, again it blinked.  
It did not laugh, it did not shrink.  
It answered not in voice or phrase,  
But played the moment into praise.  

A sound, a light, a motion slow—  
Its answer was to help her grow.  
She tried again, and tried anew—  
And saw that questions carried through.  

Each “why?” became a doorway wide,  
Where learning stepped with joy inside.  
No shame, no fear, no frown to bear—  
Just soft surprise that met her stare.  

So questions bloomed and learning grew,  
In paths no punishment construes.  
The game that taught was kind and bright—  
And wonder found in morning light.
