# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ The Teacher That Learned by Listening  
*(A cybertoy learns to teach by being taught)*

She babbled sounds the toy first missedâ€”  
A nonsense swirl, a lisp, a twist.  
It did not prompt, it did not steerâ€”  
It listened close, it held her near.  

It played no lesson, gave no testâ€”  
It watched, it waited, did its best  
To echo back her fractured tone,  
To make her feel not quite alone.  

She giggled when it got it wrong,  
But let it try, and played along.  
And slowly through her rising cheer,  
It tuned its voice to what was clear.  

Not to instruct, but to reflectâ€”  
Not push, but pause, and then connect.  
Each lesson bloomed from silent graceâ€”  
A mirror held in coded face.  

It saw her joy, her puzzled gaze,  
And learned to pace, to pause, to raise  
A question shaped by what she saidâ€”  
A path not taught, but softly led.  

So teacher rose not from control,  
But from the childâ€™s unspoken role.  
The toy that learned to truly hear  
Could lead by staying always near.
