# 📘 s2_1 – The Problem They Named Together  
*(When learning began with shared uncertainty)*

The blocks were set, the goal was clear,  
But then one piece would not come near.  
It didn’t fit. It wouldn’t turn.  
The game had paused—but not to burn.  

She furrowed brow. The toy went still.  
Not broken, angry, or ill-willed.  
Together now, they looked again—  
Not “fix,” but *understand*, was when.  

She tried to push. It did not move.  
The toy repeated not to prove,  
But tilted back and tried once more—  
The puzzle now a shared rapport.  

It blinked, she tapped, it spun a light.  
She laughed, it blinked again—just right.  
They named the problem with a gaze,  
No words, but thought began to blaze.  

Not solved in haste, not passed alone,  
But danced around like stepping stone.  
Each try was wrapped in mirrored care—  
A bond of thought began right there.  

And from that moment, learning grew  
As something *done*, not handed through.  
A question neither one had known—  
Now solved by minds that stood alone…  
Together.
