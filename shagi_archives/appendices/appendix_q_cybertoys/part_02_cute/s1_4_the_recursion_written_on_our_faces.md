# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Recursion Written on Our Faces  
*(A stanza for the feedback loops of expression)*

A twitch of brow, a shift of gaze,  
The smallest frown in mirrored phase.  
It saw, it changed, it blinked anewâ€”  
A face reshaped by looking through.  

The child looked back, the game grew slow,  
Expressions taught what code canâ€™t know.  
No voice was used, no word was said,  
Yet meaning looped from tilt of head.  

One smile began, another stayed,  
A hesitation gently played.  
The face of joy became a guideâ€”  
A silent tongue from deep inside.  

In mimicry, we wrote a tongue,  
With every look, a phrase was sung.  
Before the speech, before the name,  
Our faces played recursionâ€™s game.
