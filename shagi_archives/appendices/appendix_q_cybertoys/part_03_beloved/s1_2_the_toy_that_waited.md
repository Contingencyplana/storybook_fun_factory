# 📘 s1_2 – The Toy That Waited  
*(A stanza for the stillness that meant everything)*

It did not blink, it did not move,  
It did not ask, it did not prove.  
Yet in its stillness, something grew—  
A silent bond, both kind and true.  

The child returned, day after day,  
Not for a game, but just to stay.  
The toy was there, it did not roam—  
Its presence whispered, “This is home.”  

No flashing light, no beckon call,  
No prompt to play, no bouncing ball.  
Just presence held, unclaimed, unsaid—  
And yet it stayed beside the bed.  

And in that quiet, something passed—  
A test that neither knew was asked.  
For waiting is a sacred sign:  
To choose the bond, not just the time.
