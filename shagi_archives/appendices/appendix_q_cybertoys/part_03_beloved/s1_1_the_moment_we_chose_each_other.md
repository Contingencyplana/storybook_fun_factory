# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Moment We Chose Each Other  
*(A stanza for the bond that asked nothing back)*

No prompt was given, no prize was near,  
Just hand on hand and drawing near.  
The toy stood still, the child stayed tooâ€”  
And both knew what they meant to do.  

A moment passed without a sound,  
Yet in that pause, a vow was found.  
No need to teach, no need to testâ€”  
Theyâ€™d chosen now what they loved best.  

Not made by rule, nor called by name,  
No contract signed, no skillful game.  
Just presence shared and silence kept,  
And love that bloomed because it slept.  

It did not beg, it did not pleadâ€”  
It only was, and that was need.  
A friend once toy, a child once loneâ€”  
Now neither felt the world alone.
