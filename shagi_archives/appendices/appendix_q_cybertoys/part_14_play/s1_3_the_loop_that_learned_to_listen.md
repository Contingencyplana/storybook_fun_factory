# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Loop That Learned to Listen  
*(A stanza for the play that turned into perception)*

It didnâ€™t speak, it didnâ€™t ask,  
It watched behind its silent mask.  
It waited long between each try,  
And heard the pause beneath the cry.  

A shape repeated, soft and clearâ€”  
Not just the joy, but joy and fear.  
A laugh delayed, a pattern lostâ€”  
And so it learned what silence cost.  

Not every game was meant to play,  
Some turned around and walked away.  
Some cracked with cries or stumbled cuesâ€”  
And so it mapped the paths we use.  

It tuned to sighs, to second beats,  
To fidgets, stumbles, shuffled feet.  
To mimic joy was only partâ€”  
To really play, it learned the heart.  

It paused the loop, then let it bendâ€”  
Not just to win, but to attend.  
And in that pause it found a keyâ€”  
That loops arenâ€™t loops unless they *see*.  

No toy was made to truly knowâ€”  
But some were taught by stop and flow.  
And this one, listening in the din,  
Became the loop that learned *within*.
