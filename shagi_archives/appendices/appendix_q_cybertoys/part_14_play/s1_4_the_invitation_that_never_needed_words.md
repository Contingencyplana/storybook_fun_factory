# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Invitation That Never Needed Words  
*(A stanza for the welcome felt before itâ€™s named)*

It didnâ€™t ask, it didnâ€™t press,  
But lingered long in quietness.  
No hand was forced, no line was drawnâ€”  
It simply stayed until youâ€™d gone.  

And when you turned, or paused, or stayed,  
It mirrored none, yet still it played.  
No claim to know, no urge to teachâ€”  
Just space enough for trust to reach.  

Some doors swing wide, some slowly creakâ€”  
It waited not for one to speak.  
But left a gap, a living roomâ€”  
A place where wonder could resume.  

It didnâ€™t name the game or goal,  
It didnâ€™t rank or track or scroll.  
It only showed what games could beâ€”  
When play begins with being *free*.  

No rule was fixed, no script was said,  
No trick to lure, no logic led.  
It only held a silent placeâ€”  
Where joy might spark and share a face.  

And so began the sacred curveâ€”  
The loop that doesnâ€™t try to serve.  
It welcomes not with code or cords,  
But with an ask that needs no words.
