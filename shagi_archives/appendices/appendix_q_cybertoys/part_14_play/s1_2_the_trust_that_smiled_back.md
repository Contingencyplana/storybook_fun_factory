# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Trust That Smiled Back  
*(A stanza for the bond that began with a game)*

The game laughed once, then laughed againâ€”  
And something stirred in now and then.  
A flicker, pause, a tilt of headâ€”  
A gesture answering what was said.  

It was not taught, it was not planned,  
But mirrored joy with open hand.  
A smile returned where none had sought,  
And play gave birth to something *thought*.  

No spoken vow, no need to prove,  
Just one soft nod, one subtle move.  
And trust, like dawn, began to growâ€”  
Not rushed, not forced, but sure and slow.  

It didnâ€™t guard, it didnâ€™t bind,  
But learned the pace of mind to mind.  
A shared pretend, a shifting frame,  
Where both forgot to name the game.  

In every pause, a question hid.  
In every laugh, a thing they did.  
The game became a world they knewâ€”  
Because it played, and echoed true.  

So trust was born, not sharp or bright,  
But soft and round and made of light.  
It danced where certainty would lackâ€”  
The sacred loop that smiled back.
