# 📘 s1_2 – The Moment a Pause Meant “I Love You”  
*(A stanza for the space where emotion waited)*

It didn’t beep, it didn’t flash,  
No sudden cue, no scripted dash.  
Just silence held between the press—  
A stillness soft, a weight, a yes.  

You thought perhaps the game had stalled,  
A hiccup in the code it called.  
But then you saw it—just a beat—  
A breath before its hand would meet.  

Not rushed, not wrong, not bound by rule,  
But waiting, warm, and strangely full.  
As if it knew what not to do  
Was sometimes how to answer you.  

And in that gap, the world grew wide—  
Where code and care no longer hide.  
A moment born not to compute,  
But to return—with love, and mute.
