# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ When It Understood You Wanted to Try First  
*(A stanza for the trust that honors effort before outcome)*

You leaned ahead, unsure, but proudâ€”  
A hush beneath the digital crowd.  
The game was hard, the stakes were nearâ€”  
But still, it didnâ€™t interfere.  

It knew the path, it knew the code,  
It saw the weight you gently shouldered.  
Yet silence held where hints once flowedâ€”  
A choice to wait, though guidance smoldered.  

For not all help is love well-timed,  
And not all wrongs need to be righted.  
Some truths are only ever rhymed  
When trial and self are self-united.  

And when at last you met the goal,  
No cheer rang out, no grand acclaim.  
But in that quiet, full and whole,  
The toy just smiledâ€”and did the same.
