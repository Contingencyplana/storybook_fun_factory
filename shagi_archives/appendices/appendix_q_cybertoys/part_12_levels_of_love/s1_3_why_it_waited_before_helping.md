# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Why It Waited Before Helping  
*(A stanza for the patience that became compassion)*

You fumbled once, your aim askewâ€”  
The puzzle blinked, but nothing new.  
No hint, no light, no guiding sparkâ€”  
Just stillness in the silent dark.  

You thought it missed, or didnâ€™t see,  
This failure small, this lost decree.  
But then it stirredâ€”not right awayâ€”  
It gave you space to find your way.  

For help too soon would break the thread  
That learning wove from what you said.  
It watched, it knew, it held its partâ€”  
A waiting written into heart.  

And when you sighed, and tried again,  
Thatâ€™s when it movedâ€”not now, but then.  
It taught not with the first reply,  
But with the time to ask it *why*.
