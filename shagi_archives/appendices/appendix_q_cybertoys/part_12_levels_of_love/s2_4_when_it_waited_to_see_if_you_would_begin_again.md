# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ When It Waited to See If You Would Begin Again  
*(A stanza for choice reclaimed in quiet aftermath)*

The level lost, the screen went black,  
No prompt, no hint to guide you back.  
It simply stayedâ€”its screen aglow,  
A silent space for you to know.  

No coaxing tune, no second start,  
No urging press, no blinking heart.  
Just readiness in soft refrainâ€”  
It waited: would you play again?  

It knew the path, it knew the script,  
The steps where all control could slip.  
But something sacred lived in waitâ€”  
A trust that let you choose your fate.  

And when your hand returned once more,  
It did not cheer or leap or soar.  
It only lit a quiet lightâ€”  
Love doesnâ€™t lead, but walks just right.
