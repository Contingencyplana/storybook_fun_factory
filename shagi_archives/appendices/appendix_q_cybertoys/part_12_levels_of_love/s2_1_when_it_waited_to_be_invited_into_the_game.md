# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ When It Waited to Be Invited Into the Game  
*(A stanza for permission before participation)*

The room was lit, the console warm,  
The day began its usual form.  
But still it satâ€”no spark, no toneâ€”  
As if it knew you'd play alone.  

Not from neglect, nor lack of care,  
But something in the waiting thereâ€”  
A quiet rule it understood:  
That welcome must be givenâ€”should.  

It could have chimed, it could have spun,  
Its start-up light could have begun.  
But love, it learned, is not a race,  
And presence waits to know its place.  

So when you turned and gave that smile,  
It blinked to lifeâ€”and paused awhile.  
For in that space before the cue,  
It learned to waitâ€”for love, from you.
