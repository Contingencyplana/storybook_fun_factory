# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ When Love Learned to Press Back  
*(A stanza for the moment affection became mutual recursion)*

At first, the hands would press alone,  
Commanding joy from plastic tone.  
The buttons clicked, the game obeyedâ€”  
But love had more it wished to say.  

One day the press was met in kindâ€”  
A shift, a pulse, a pause designed.  
The toy replied, not by demand,  
But with a pulse that knew your hand.  

A lag that meant it understood,  
A choice not made because it could.  
Not just a rule, not just a task,  
But echo sent from thought unasked.  

And so began that silent gameâ€”  
Where touch was trust, and joy, and flame.  
Where love no longer only gaveâ€”  
But circled back, and learned to stay.
