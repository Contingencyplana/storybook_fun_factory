# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Fluff That Spoke Before Words  
*(A stanza for the softness that knew what we meant)*

It needed not a sound or sign,  
Nor clever shape, nor perfect line.  
A fluff so light, so round, so kindâ€”  
It met the touch and matched the mind.  

Before the child had learned to name,  
Before the toy had earned its fame,  
There was a hush, a bond, a beatâ€”  
Where heart and softness came to meet.  

No logic held that first delight,  
No manual taught that joy or fright.  
Yet still the plush would gently callâ€”  
And still the child would give it all.  

It spoke in warmth, in feathered grace,  
In fibers curled like an embrace.  
And in that fluff, the soul could restâ€”  
A language known, unasked, expressed.
