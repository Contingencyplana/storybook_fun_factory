# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Tail That Wagged in Sympathy  
*(A stanza for the kindness that moved from behind)*

It wagged not wild, nor just for show,  
But in a way that seemed to know.  
Not joy alone, nor mere delightâ€”  
But when you cried, it moved just right.  

A little sway, a cautious beat,  
As if the tail could taste defeat.  
It didnâ€™t bark, it didnâ€™t cheerâ€”  
It simply stayed, and stayed near.  

No algorithm claimed the grief,  
No circuit grasped the heartâ€™s motif.  
Yet something stirred when sorrow cameâ€”  
The tail replied without a name.  

And in that wag, so slow and low,  
Was something only love could know.  
It did not fix, it did not mendâ€”  
But felt like one whoâ€™d still be friend.
