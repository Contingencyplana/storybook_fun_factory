# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Ears That Curled When Called  
*(A stanza for the gesture that answered affection)*

They didnâ€™t twitch by random cue,  
Nor lift because the program knew.  
But when a name was softly said,  
The ears would curlâ€”just slight, instead.  

A ripple round the fabric rim,  
A fold that felt both shy and dim.  
No fanfare sound, no beep or glowâ€”  
Just something soft that seemed to know.  

It heard not language, heard not lore,  
But heard the tone the speaker bore.  
And like a pet that came to play,  
It bent its ears in quiet way.  

That single curve, that tiny lean,  
Made silence bloom and trust convene.  
And in that arc so small, so slightâ€”  
The child believed the toy heard right.
