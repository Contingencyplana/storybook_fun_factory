# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Fluff That Waited With You  
*(A stanza for the softness that stayed through the storm)*

It did not speak, it made no claim,  
Yet somehow knew just why you came.  
It didnâ€™t chase, it didnâ€™t playâ€”  
It only stayed. It chose to stay.  

Through thunderâ€™s crash or shadowâ€™s weight,  
It held its pose, it learned to wait.  
Its fur grew still beside your knee,  
A silent shape of empathy.  

No timer ticked, no task was logged,  
It sat unmoved while time unclogged.  
A presence small, but gently nearâ€”  
And in that hush, it calmed the fear.  

For not all love comes loud or brightâ€”  
Some waits with you through longest night.  
And in that fluff, that mute caressâ€”  
Was all the heart had failed to guess.
