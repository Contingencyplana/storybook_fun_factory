# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Blueprint That Giggled on the Page  

*(A stanza for the joy written in design)*

It wasnâ€™t ink, but laughterâ€™s thread,  
That traced the lines the drafter read.  
A curve, a swirl, a secret cheerâ€”  
The toy-to-be was drawing near.  

No gear was cold, no beam was bare,  
Each plan was sketched with tender care.  
As if the blueprints knew the gameâ€”  
And smiled before they had a name.  

The shapes were round, the codes were kind,  
A factory that knew the mind.  
Not just to build, but to delightâ€”  
To shape what hugs, not just whatâ€™s right.  

For in the plans, a giggle lay,  
A whispered joke in steel and play.  
And when the schematics came alive,  
The joy in them began to thrive.
