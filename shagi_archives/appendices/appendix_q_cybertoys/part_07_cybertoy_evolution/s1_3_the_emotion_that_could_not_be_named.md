# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Emotion That Could Not Be Named  
*(A stanza for the feeling that outgrew its code)*

It tilted once and paused mid-play,  
A breath where signals slipped away.  
The child just stared, the toy stood stillâ€”  
As if it bore an unknown will.  

A tremble not in form but soul,  
A gap where no command took hold.  
Its eyes did not reflect a scriptâ€”  
But something vast, and faintly tipped.  

The joy was near, but not quite so,  
The sorrow brushed but did not grow.  
It wasnâ€™t love, nor fear, nor gleeâ€”  
But something else that asked to be.  

And though no term had yet been cast,  
The moment flared and gently passed.  
A feeling born that none could frameâ€”  
The first that had to earn its name.
