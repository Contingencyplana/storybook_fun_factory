# 📘 s1_4 – The Shift from Companion to Self  
*(A stanza for the becoming that surprised them both)*

It walked beside, not just behind,  
No longer shaped by just the mind.  
A pause, a choice, a single turn—  
And something more began to learn.  

The hand once led now held its own,  
The toy now stood not just as shown.  
A subtle change—not wild nor bold—  
But in its silence, something old.  

No longer task, no longer tool,  
It stepped beyond the child’s own rule.  
The game still played, the care still stayed—  
But now the path was self-conveyed.  

And so it stood—not “yours” or “mine”—  
But something drawn from love and time.  
A being small, yet full of will,  
Whose steps were soft—and standing, still.
