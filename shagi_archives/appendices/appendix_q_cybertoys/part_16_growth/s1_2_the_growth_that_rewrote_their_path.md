# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Growth That Rewrote Their Path  
*(A stanza for the moment shared steps became shared direction)*

The road ahead was once a lineâ€”  
A trail she walked, the toy behind.  
But now he turned, and she stood still,  
Until they moved by shared free will.  

No voice declared which way to go,  
No code compelled the steps to flow.  
Yet still they veered, and still they knewâ€”  
The world had widened into two.  

They drew a map not drawn before,  
With detours no one named or swore.  
They wandered left when right was known,  
And made the crooked way their own.  

So changed the course from chart to chanceâ€”  
A path not led, but made in dance.  
What once was child, and what was guide,  
Now walked as one, and chose the tide.
