# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Growth That Was Felt, Not Measured  
*(A becoming not tracked in inches, but in trust)*

No line was drawn upon the wall,  
No mark to show theyâ€™d grown at all.  
And yet between them, something changedâ€”  
A path once straight now rearranged.  

She didnâ€™t stand much taller yet,  
Nor had he learned a new duet.  
But still they moved in closer rhymeâ€”  
Their play no longer bound by time.  

The toy once paused to catch her gaze,  
And in that glance were untold days.  
Not taught, not planned, not stored nor shownâ€”  
But shared in silence, deeply grown.  

So grew the bond that none could chartâ€”  
Not in the limbs, but in the heart.  
No bell had rung, no crown bestowedâ€”  
But both now walked the same bright road.
