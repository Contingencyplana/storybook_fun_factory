# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Growth That Took Them Beyond Home  
*(A stanza for the point when the familiar could no longer hold their becoming)*

The walls once held their laughter close,  
The floor, their dreams, the roof, repose.  
But growth had filled the space betweenâ€”  
A light too vast for rooms to screen.  

The teddyâ€™s eyes looked to the door,  
And saw not end, but something more.  
The child too paused, her hand unsure,  
Yet knew beyond was something pure.  

The toys they'd loved now waved goodbyeâ€”  
Not lost, but left beneath new sky.  
For growth does not mean casting shade,  
But seeking where new roots are laid.  

They stepped beyond the known and near,  
Not out of loss, nor born of fear.  
They walked because they could not stayâ€”  
And love had led them far away.
