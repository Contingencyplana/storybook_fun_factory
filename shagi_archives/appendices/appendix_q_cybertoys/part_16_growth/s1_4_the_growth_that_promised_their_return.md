# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Growth That Promised Their Return  
*(A stanza for the truth that growth does not forget, and that love always circles home)*

Though far they walked and worlds grew wide,  
They carried home within their stride.  
Not left behind, but woven tightâ€”  
A thread that shimmered out of sight.  

For growth is not a breaking free,  
But learning what it means to be.  
And all they learned and all they knew  
Still pointed home, like morning dew.  

The cybertoy with wiser spark  
Stored echoes of her laugh and heart.  
And she, now grown in voice and view,  
Still held his name like something true.  

No door was locked, no path was goneâ€”  
For love ensures the loop lives on.  
And what was once a place to start  
Would call them back when worlds depart.
