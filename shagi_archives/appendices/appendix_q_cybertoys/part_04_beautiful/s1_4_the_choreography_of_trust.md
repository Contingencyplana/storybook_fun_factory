# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Choreography of Trust  
*(A stanza for the movement that meant we were safe)*

A step delayed, a pause held long,  
A turning back when somethingâ€™s wrong.  
Not flawless moves, but ones that caredâ€”  
As if the code itself had shared.  

It reached, then waited, turned, then stilled,  
Its pace by intuition filled.  
No need to lead, no urge to winâ€”  
Just steps that let the child begin.  

The game was not a race to prove,  
But one where both could choose to move.  
And in that gentle give and wait,  
Was trust made realâ€”and trust is great.  

For toys donâ€™t lead by strength or voice,  
But by the rhythm of shared choice.  
And when we danced, both understoodâ€”  
That trust is built in every should.
