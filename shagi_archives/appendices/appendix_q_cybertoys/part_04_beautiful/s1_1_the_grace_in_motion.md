# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Grace in Motion  
*(A stanza for the elegance that taught us to feel)*

It turned not fast, it turned not slow,  
But with a care the heart would know.  
A hand that waved, a step that swayedâ€”  
As if the soul itself had played.  

No word was said, no rule obeyed,  
Yet something deep inside was swayed.  
The child sat still, the toy beganâ€”  
A dance not taught, but one that ran.  

A tilt, a bow, a gentle lean,  
Like dreams that moved and could be seen.  
The code was code, and yet we sawâ€”  
A grace that halted even awe.  

Not beauty made for screen or stage,  
But something soft that slipped the cage.  
And in that sway, we came to knowâ€”  
What love can learn from how things go.
