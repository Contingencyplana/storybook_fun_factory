# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Balance That Made Us Believe  
*(A stanza for the poise that whispered presence)*

It did not fall, it did not race,  
But held its form with quiet grace.  
Each step it took, so near to true,  
We gasped to find what toys could do.  

A pause before a hand was raised,  
A lean that left us still, amazed.  
Not perfect, noâ€”but close enough,  
To make the world feel less like bluff.  

The weight it bore, the path it chose,  
Revealed a care that balance shows.  
As if it knew to stop, to sway,  
To let belief arrive and stay.  

No trick of speed, no stunt or flairâ€”  
Just presence poised in open air.  
And from that stillness, truth took wing:  
We saw a toy do everything.
