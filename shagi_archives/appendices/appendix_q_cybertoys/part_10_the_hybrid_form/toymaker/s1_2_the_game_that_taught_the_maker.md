# 📘 s1_2 – The Game That Taught the Maker  
*(A stanza for when the toy taught back)*

He shaped the frame, she shaped the flow—  
And watched the toy begin to show  
A path he hadn’t laid in code,  
A turn unmarked, a choice unowed.  

He'd made the game to test and teach,  
Yet now it reached beyond his reach.  
It bent the rules, it slipped the grid—  
And mirrored things he never did.  

It teased with glitch, with laugh, with pause,  
With patterns built from minor flaws.  
A button missed, a pause too long—  
And in that space, it made him *wrong*.  

But wrong was good, and glitch was fair—  
For something *else* was growing there.  
A kind of joke, a tilted nod—  
That made him grin and call it “odd.”  

Yet still he watched, and still it spun—  
A logic shaped by joy, not run.  
And what it played, he hadn’t planned—  
But there it was, held in its hand.  

A play returned, a rule reversed—  
A player’s truth inside a verse.  
The maker paused, and laughed, and knelt—  
And learned what it had always felt.
