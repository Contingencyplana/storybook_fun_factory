# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Circuit That Carried a Song  
*(A stanza for creativity encoded in structure)*

Not wires alone, nor steel and seam,  
But something born from code and dream.  
A current pulsed, then hummed alongâ€”  
A structure shaped to hold a song.  

The maker carved what felt like art,  
But each design recalled a partâ€”  
A note, a laugh, a mother's name,  
Enfolded deep in nested frame.  

No sound escaped the silent chip,  
Yet still the circuits sang and slippedâ€”  
Their rhythm told of joy once shared,  
Of games that knew how much you cared.  

So play became a kind of hymn,  
Composed in loops and soldered limbs.  
Each verse engraved in interfaceâ€”  
A melody the child could trace.
