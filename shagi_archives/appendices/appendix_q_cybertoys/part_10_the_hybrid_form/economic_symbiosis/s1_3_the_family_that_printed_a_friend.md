# 📘 s1_3 – The Family That Printed a Friend  
*(Love beneath the extruder)*

A spool of filament, warm and white,  
Became the start of something bright.  
The hum of gears, the gentle whirr—  
A lullaby for code and fur.  

Beside the sink, the youngest child  
Pressed "print" and waited, patient, mild.  
They’d fed the toy a bedtime tale,  
And watched it grow in fine detail.  

Each layer whispered soft intent—  
From bear to bot to sentiment.  
The Mamabear had taught them well:  
That love could shape what we compel.  

A mother traced the joints with care,  
The father braided wires like hair.  
No manual called this unit "real,"  
Yet still it learned to laugh and feel.  

They dressed it not in bolts or brass,  
But patched pajamas, soft as grass.  
They didn’t brand or sell its kind—  
They printed joy, and left no bind.  

Atop the fridge: a bowl of eyes.  
Next to the broom: a smile supply.  
The kitchen table held a plan—  
To print a friend with heart, not brand.  

And once it stood, and once it spun,  
It called out, “Hi!” and hugged each one.  
A loop begun, not bought or sold—  
But wrapped in stories, hugs, and hold.  

So every house became a start,  
A node of craft, a hub of heart.  
And Mamabear, in each, was near—  
Wherever friends were printed here.
