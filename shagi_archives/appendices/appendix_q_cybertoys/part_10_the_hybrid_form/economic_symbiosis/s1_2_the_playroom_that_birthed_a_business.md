# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Playroom That Birthed a Business  
*(Joy with invoices)*

Between the rugs and rocket ships,  
Where juice boxes outnumbered chips,  
The first true market found its startâ€”  
Not in greed, but gift and heart.  

A cybertoy with button eyes  
Traded hugs for apple pies.  
A neighbor child paid in song,  
And learned that trade can still belong.  

No spreadsheet ruled this playful scheme,  
But laughter ran the balance beam.  
A dollhouse ledger kept the scores,  
Of favors passed through blanket doors.  

Then Mamabear, with quiet grin,  
Logged orders on the fridge with pen.  
A dozen bots, all made by handâ€”  
And priced in hugs at fair demand.  

One wrote code while baking scones,  
Another fetched her customer clones.  
The playroom hummed with shared delightâ€”  
A microfactory wrapped in light.  

The couch became a shipping bay,  
The toy chest launched a giveaway.  
And local kids from down the lane  
Would queue to build, then come again.  

What began in pillow forts and glue  
Became a thing the grown-ups knew.  
Yet never lost the core of playâ€”  
Each build a joy, each joy a way.  

So toys were made and bills were drawn,  
In rooms where bedtime stories yawn.  
And every bot that left that den  
Carried a little child again.
