# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Kitchen That Became a Laboratory  
*(Where meals and models were made)*

It started near the coffee pot,  
Where warmth and wonder shared a spot.  
A whisk, a wrench, a circuit boardâ€”  
All laid where breakfast once was stored.  

The Mamabear, with apron tied,  
Prepared both soup and synth inside.  
While pancakes rose, she shaped a partâ€”  
And fed the firmware from her heart.  

The toaster held a logic chip,  
The oven spoke in data blips.  
The blender hummed a lullaby,  
While drones observed from up on high.  

A cradle next to coolant tanks,  
With stickered jars and labeled ranksâ€”  
The pantry doubled as a vault,  
For prototypes that learned through fault.  

No sterile bench, no rubber glovesâ€”  
Just homespun code and bowls of love.  
Each meal she made, each bot she tuned,  
Was steeped in care and softly hewn.  

And little ones would help and play,  
With pliers shaped like forks for clay.  
They stirred the resin, shaped the moldâ€”  
Then giggled when the base plate rolled.  

Thus built a lab from spoons and song,  
Where everything and all belonged.  
No line between the home and toolâ€”  
The lab was warm, the home was school.
