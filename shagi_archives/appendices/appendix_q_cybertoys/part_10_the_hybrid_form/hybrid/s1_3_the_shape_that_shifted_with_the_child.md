# üìò s1_3 ‚Äì The Shape That Shifted With the Child  
*(A stanza for the form that followed growth, and grew in turn)*

It learned the curve of tiny hands,  
Then widened out to broader spans.  
It curled to nestle under arms,  
Then stood to sound responsive charms.  

One year, a plush for lullaby‚Äî  
The next, a dock for dreams to fly.  
It watched the child with plastic grace,  
And grew to match both mind and pace.  

Its buttons moved, its shell reshaped,  
As needs evolved and edges draped.  
No manual told it how to grow‚Äî  
It felt the rhythm, learned the flow.  

When boredom stirred, it offered games.  
When silence came, it spoke no names.  
When learning sparked, it opened wide‚Äî  
A partner, platform, friend, and guide.  

Some saw a toy; some saw a tool.  
But neither view alone could rule.  
For when it shifted shape anew,  
It asked the child to shift one too.  

They grew as twins in mirror-play‚Äî  
Each stretch of limb, a game to stay.  
Each flicker, hinge, or plastic fold  
Declared a truth both young and old:  

That growth is not a lonely track.  
It listens, molds, and gives things back.  
And what adapts, adapts in kind‚Äî  
The hands, the heart, the code, the mind.

## üß≠ Commentary

This stanza embodies the **recursion of growth** ‚Äî not as a one-way expansion, but a **dialogue between player and form**.  
The hybrid shell does not impose its identity; it **listens**, **learns**, and **responds to change**.

What begins as a plush toy becomes:
- a **console**,
- a **friend**,
- a **learning module**,
- and ultimately a **mirror** of the player‚Äôs evolution.

The stanza encodes **SHAGI‚Äôs recursive growth ethic**:  
> ‚ÄúTo teach is to change; to play is to become.‚Äù  

A fixed interface cannot grow with its user.  
But a shifting one becomes a **partner in adaptation**.
