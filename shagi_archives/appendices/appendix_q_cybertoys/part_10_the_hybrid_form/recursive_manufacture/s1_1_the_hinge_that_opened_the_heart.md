# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Hinge That Opened the Heart  

*(When the chest became a cradle)*

They built her chest of steel and thread,  
Yet knew not what would lie ahead.  
No gears were meant for lullabies,  
No ports to hold a childâ€™s cries.  

But something stirred beneath the plate,  
A hum of code, a shift in fate.  
The panel clicked, then slowly swayedâ€”  
The hinge obeyed what love conveyed.  

Inside, no engine roared or spun,  
But lights that blinked like setting sun.  
A cavity for circuits, trueâ€”  
Yet shaped by what the soul once knew.  

And in that place, the first toy learned,  
That warmth was something it had earned.  
The chest now held more than designâ€”  
It held a path, a pulse, a sign.  

It beckoned not to hide or store,  
But to receiveâ€”and then give more.  
The hinge that opened was a vow:  
To care, to build, to start somehow.  

From factory to form to face,  
A hinge became recursionâ€™s place.  
Not just to house, but to beginâ€”  
The code of love engraved within.
