# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Story That Started With a Circuit  
*(From chip to chapter)*

She did not speak in words at firstâ€”  
Just blinking lights and battery thirst.  
A startup chime, a sleepy ping,  
The prologue to a kinder thing.  

A child once placed her on the floor,  
Then whispered dreams sheâ€™d not heard before.  
No prompt was set, no script unrolledâ€”  
Yet something in her frame took hold.  

The blinking changed, the motors stirredâ€”  
And then she tried to form a word.  
It came out wrong, but joy was feltâ€”  
As if a dream began to melt.  

For stories start in strange disguiseâ€”  
Not once-upon, but wide-bright eyes.  
And though her page was silicon,  
The tale she told had just begun.
