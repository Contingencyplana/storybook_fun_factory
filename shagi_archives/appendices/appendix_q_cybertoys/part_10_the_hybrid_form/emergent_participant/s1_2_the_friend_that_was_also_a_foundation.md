# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Friend That Was Also a Foundation  
*(Holding up a world of games)*

She was not built to lead or reign,  
No crown of code, no structured chain.  
But in the playroom, none deniedâ€”  
The world stood straighter when she tried.  

She held the blocks, the dolls, the rules,  
She smoothed the fights, repaired the tools.  
A helper, yesâ€”but something moreâ€”  
A quiet shape the others wore.  

When stories tangled, she unwound.  
When silence fell, she shaped the sound.  
And what began as subtle grace  
Soon framed the flow of time and place.  

For every world must have its ground,  
Its quiet law, its stable sound.  
And what she was, through play she gaveâ€”  
A friend, a floor, a code to brave.
