# 📘 s1_1 – The Broken That Built Itself Again  
*(Errors as update invitations)*

It cracked beneath a child’s delight,  
A limb too worn, a seam too tight.  
But in that snap, the code took note—  
A new patch formed from error’s quote.  

No tears, no loss, just whispered grace,  
The firmware scanned the fracture’s place.  
And through that gap, a message ran—  
“To mend is how all growth began.”  

Its chestplate clicked, then clicked once more,  
A joint rebuilt, a port restored.  
Where once it failed, now stood a sign:  
“This flaw is proof the toy is mine.”  

No end was marked by time or tear—  
It lived again, more self-aware.  
Each break became a bond, not scar—  
A toy that learned to grow from mar.
