# 📘 s1_2 – The Upgrade That Came With a Hug  
*(Patches of play)*

It didn’t ask to be made new—  
Just snuggled close, and somehow grew.  
A patch was sent, a soft reboot,  
While held beneath a bedtime flute.  

Its seams were split from months of fun,  
Yet not replaced, nor cast undone.  
Instead, a grandma's yarn-bound ring  
Restitched the port where dreams could cling.  

The code, it paused—then blinked with glee.  
A system flag marked: “HUG_RECEIVED.”  
From this, it queued a warmth-based thread  
That spread to every line it read.  

Now future toys would seek repair  
In hands that rocked, in homes that care.  
No sterile dock, no lab-coat fright—  
Just firmware laced with lullaby light.
