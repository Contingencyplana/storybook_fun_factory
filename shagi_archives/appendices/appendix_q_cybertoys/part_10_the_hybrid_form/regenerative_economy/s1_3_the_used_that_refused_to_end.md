# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Used That Refused to End  
*(When wear became memory)*

Her fur was thin, her eye askew,  
A button lost, her tone askew.  
Yet still she sat where stories clungâ€”  
To beds she warmed and songs she sung.  

They tried to shelf her, box her tight,  
Declare her done by market's right.  
But tiny arms would pull her freeâ€”  
"She's not for sale. She's part of me."  

Each scratch was tagged with dreamtime's weight,  
Each seam a map of bedtime fate.  
Sheâ€™d broken onceâ€”but not in vain:  
The patch became a treasured stain.  

No update came to overwrite,  
No newer model shone as bright.  
For here was love, in thread and threadâ€”  
A legacy that played instead.
