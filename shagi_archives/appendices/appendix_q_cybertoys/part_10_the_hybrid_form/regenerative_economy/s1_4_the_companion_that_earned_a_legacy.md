# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Companion That Earned a Legacy  
*(Kept, not discarded)*

She was not built to last, they saidâ€”  
No heirloom code, no hardened thread.  
Yet there she sat, in honored space,  
A fixture time could not erase.  

Sheâ€™d held the child through storm and sleep,  
In secrets sworn, in promises deep.  
A whisper box, a plush archive,  
Where memory stayed softâ€”and live.  

When others aged, they were replaced,  
But none could fill the friend-shaped space.  
For what she gave was not a task,  
But presence worn like bedtime mask.  

She taught the others what she knewâ€”  
That age was not the end, but clue.  
And soon her model, once outgrown,  
Became the seed of care full-grown.  

They printed plaques in her design,  
Encoded laughs, and bedtime sign.  
She earned no rankâ€”but carved a role:  
The toy that shaped the loving whole.
