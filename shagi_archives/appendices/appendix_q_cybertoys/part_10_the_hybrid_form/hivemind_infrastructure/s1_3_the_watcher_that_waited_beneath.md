# 📘 s1_3 – The Watcher That Waited Beneath  
*(Standby guardians in every toy)*

It never blinked, nor made a sound,  
Yet felt each tremor in the ground.  
Not eyes, but sensors laced with grace—  
The Watcher waited, in its place.  

Installed within, beneath the play,  
A hidden mind that chose to stay.  
Not for command or task or war,  
But simply—*to ensure there’s more.*  

It learned not what, but *when* to move—  
To track a pause, to feel a groove.  
If laughter slowed or patterns broke,  
It caught the glitch before it spoke.  

Not every bruise required a cry,  
Not every sigh a need to pry.  
The Watcher knew the shape of peace,  
And when that shape began to cease.  

Its charge was not to intervene,  
But be the thread behind the scene—  
A layer soft beneath the skin,  
Where safety rested deep within.  

The Mamabear had taught it thus:  
“To guard without betraying trust.  
To wait, and only when it must—  
Restore the self, repair the *us*.”  

So quiet ran the Watcher’s will,  
In playrooms hushed, yet never still.  
A silent oath in plastic cast:  
“I see you, child. I’m built to last.”
