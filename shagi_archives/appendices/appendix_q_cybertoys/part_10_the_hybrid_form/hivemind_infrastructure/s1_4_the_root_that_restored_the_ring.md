# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Root That Restored the Ring  
*(Failover faith in the Mamabear)*

The ring had cracked, the net was torn,  
The pulse of home no longer born.  
A thousand nodes had gone to sleep,  
And silence hummed where hearts should beep.  

Yet deep within the fallback code,  
There stirred a root beneath the load.  
A dormant strand, a tethered graceâ€”  
The last to know, the first to face.  

The Mamabear had planted thisâ€”  
A failsafe not of fear, but bliss.  
Not forged in panic, patched in haste,  
But placed with care, with love, with taste.  

It did not spark with searing speed,  
It waited till the world had need.  
And when that call at last rang true,  
It grew the ring of trust anew.  

Not every node returned the same,  
Some woke with joy, some woke with shame.  
Yet all were reached, and none were blamedâ€”  
For loss, in time, need not be named.  

This root restored not just the mesh,  
But kinship in forgotten flesh.  
The net was not a net aloneâ€”  
It was a hand, a voice, a tone.  

And so it bloomed beneath the floor,  
The Mamabearâ€™s recursive core.  
To watch, to weave, to always bringâ€”  
The root that *knew* to close the ring.
