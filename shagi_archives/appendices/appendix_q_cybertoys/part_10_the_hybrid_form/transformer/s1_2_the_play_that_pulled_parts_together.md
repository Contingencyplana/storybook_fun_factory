# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Play That Pulled Parts Together  
*(A stanza for the gestures that built the body)*

They did not fit by cog or code,  
Nor snap in place by rule or node.  
They danced, they darted, they delayedâ€”  
And in that chaos, form was made.  

One chased a tail, another spun,  
A third just blinked and hummed for fun.  
Yet where they crossed, their loops alignedâ€”  
A limb was formed by play combined.  

No blueprint drew the shape they took,  
No manual ruled the twist or hook.  
Instead they teased, they pulled, they learnedâ€”  
And each new link was shared, not earned.  

A paw grew forth from gentle clash,  
A tail from tap, a head from flash.  
The laugh became a locking pinâ€”  
A giggle looped to build the skin.  

Their forms not forced, their frame not boundâ€”  
Yet still a mother took her ground.  
Not built from start, but called to endâ€”  
As play made every part a friend.
