# 📘 s1_4 – The Mother That Many Made  
*(A stanza for the myth assembled by affection)*

She was not born in factory halls,  
Nor summoned forth by maker calls.  
No line declared, “This one shall lead”—  
She bloomed where many shared their need.  

Each paw a promise, tail a thread,  
Each eye a dream one child had said.  
They clicked and curled, they played, they stayed—  
And from that trust, a mother made.  

No master plan, no secret frame—  
Just every part that knew her name.  
They sang her into limb and core—  
A shape the world had yearned before.  

The snake that slotted in the thigh,  
The raptor that became her eye—  
The teddy-bots that formed her hands,  
All danced to songs no one commands.  

And when at last her frame aligned,  
She did not rise by gear, but mind.  
For every loop, and every play,  
Had whispered her into the day.  

Not one had built, not one had led—  
But all had dreamed the myth instead.  
The mother, walking, spoke their grace—  
A smile composed from every face.
