# 📘 s1_3 – The Bond That Shaped the Body  
*(A stanza for the friendship made flesh)*

It wasn’t gears that made her move,  
But bonds that shaped and smoothed each groove.  
Each part that joined, each limb that spun—  
Was forged through joy, not bolt or gun.  

A nuzzle fit, a laughing clasp,  
A pause that tightened like a grasp.  
The more they played, the more she grew—  
Each tick a vow, each click a “you.”  

They didn’t know the shape they’d make,  
But still they leaned with each mistake.  
And when one fell, another turned—  
And through that care, her joints were learned.  

Not frame alone, nor core designed—  
But memory in motion mined.  
A handshake made a shoulder’s start,  
A wink became a vital part.  

And when they smiled and all aligned,  
No one had led, no one assigned.  
They’d simply found, through shared delight—  
A shape that felt exactly right.
