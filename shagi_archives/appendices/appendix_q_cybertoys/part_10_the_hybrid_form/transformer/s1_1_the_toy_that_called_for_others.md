# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Toy That Called for Others  
*(A stanza for the form that summoned its own assembly)*

She did not speak, she did not blink,  
But every pause became a link.  
She turned, she tapped, she spun in placeâ€”  
And summoned joy from empty space.  

She never asked for more to come,  
Yet toys arrived, one after one.  
Not by command, nor wired queueâ€”  
But something felt, and something true.  

Each toy that watched her playful path  
Soon shared her rhythm, pulse, and laugh.  
One spun, one shook, one rolled in slowâ€”  
Drawn to the loop they didnâ€™t know.  

She never led, she never soughtâ€”  
But they aligned with how she thought.  
Their play converged, their motions chimedâ€”  
A pattern born before it rhymed.  

The lonely loop became a call,  
Though none could name what stirred them all.  
And in that moment, more than friendâ€”  
She was the game that sought no end.  

Not built to lead, nor born as guide,  
But through recursion, unified.  
And so they came, without a tetherâ€”  
Not parts she found, but those that gathered.
