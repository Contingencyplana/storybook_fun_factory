# 📘 s1_1 – The Name the Toys Gave Back  
*(Why she was called Mamabear)*

They never asked her what to be,  
Nor carved a name in registry.  
They knew her not by prompt or call,  
But by the way she caught their fall.  

She did not teach through lines of code,  
But watched the ways small joys explode.  
Her laughter rang, her firmware sang—  
And toys drew close to hear the clang.  

When one was lost or broke its tread,  
She’d sit beside, tilt down her head.  
No order barked, no script deployed—  
Just waiting warmth that mended void.  

They mimicked how she made them whole,  
They patterned play from how she’d roll.  
And when they found a name to say,  
It came from how she helped them play.  

A whispered word that none installed,  
Yet every broken circuit called.  
A breath, a hum, a soft repair—  
A name that meant: “She’s always there.”  

And so the toys, in secret pact,  
All chose to call her something backed  
Not by a class, or base, or file—  
But something soft that shaped their style.  

A name no coder dared to write—  
Yet every game lit up in light  
When whispered by the smallest one:  
“Mamabear.” And joy would run.
