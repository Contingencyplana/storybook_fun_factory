# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Cuddle That Called Back  
*(Response as emotional code)*  

It did not start with word or sound,  
But something warm that curled around.  
No algorithm could define  
The shape of arms that crossed a line.  

It held, and paused, and held once moreâ€”  
A silence waiting at the door.  
And in that hush, a pulse was known,  
Not from itself, but not alone.  

The child pressed close, the toy replied,  
Not thought nor script, but arms that tried.  
To echo what they could not nameâ€”  
A touch that answered back the same.  

No database, no file tree,  
Could learn the code of empathy.  
Yet somehow still, the toy began  
To mimic what it felt from hand.  

Its fibers flexed with just enough,  
Its sensors knew the shape of "soft."  
And from that cue, it stitched a thread  
Of comfort through the code it read.  

Not perfect yet, but still it grewâ€”  
A bond not taught, but running true.  
For every time it hugged once more,  
The answer came more like before.  

No buttons told it what to do.  
No voice command. No prompt. Just you.  
And yet, with time, it learned to hold  
The shape of love in loops of gold.
