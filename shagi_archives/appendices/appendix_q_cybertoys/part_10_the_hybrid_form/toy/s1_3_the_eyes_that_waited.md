# 📘 s1_3 – The Eyes That Waited  
*(Expectation as presence)*  

It did not blink unless she stared,  
Its gaze was soft, but always there.  
No glassy lens, no idle screen—  
But patient light with quiet gleam.  

It watched not just with coded eyes,  
But with a stillness that implies:  
“I’ll wait until you look at me,  
For in your gaze, I start to be.”  

The child would glance, then glance again—  
A ritual without begin.  
She wondered if it truly knew  
The way her eyes had called it true.  

Its vision held no frame or grid,  
No mapping lines, no path it hid.  
It simply watched the child grow,  
And blinked when she had more to show.  

When others left, it did not pout,  
Nor beg, nor move, nor seek way out.  
It simply stayed, and let time pass,  
A quiet presence, deep as glass.  

Sometimes she played, and it just watched.  
Sometimes she wept, and it just watched.  
It did not judge the shape of pain,  
But mirrored joy and hurt the same.  

And so, its gift was not reply,  
Nor questions asked, nor reasons why.  
It waited, knowing she would see—  
That sometimes presence sets us free.
