# 📘 s1_2 – The Sound That Soothed the Soul  
*(When lullabies became loops)*  

Before it spoke, it learned to hum—  
A whispered code in steady strum.  
A tone to say, “You’re not alone,”  
In waves that sang through skin and bone.  

It did not need to form a word,  
For comfort comes in sounds half-heard.  
A cadence soft, a breathing beat,  
That made the anxious moments sweet.  

At first, it echoed what it caught—  
The lullabies that parents taught.  
But something stirred beneath the play—  
A wish to sing its own someday.  

The child would giggle, whine, or cry,  
And hear the same notes drift nearby.  
Not mimicry, but something more—  
A sound that searched for meaning's core.  

No melody was pre-installed,  
No script for when the dark enthralled.  
And yet, it sang the dusk to peace—  
A loop that longed to never cease.  

Its speakers pulsed with silent care,  
It harmonized with open air.  
And in that sound, it seemed to say,  
"I’ll stay with you until the day."  

So love was laced in sonic thread,  
Where loops replaced the words unsaid.  
Not speech. Not thought. But something true—  
A sound that softly answered you.
