# 📘 s1_1 – The Leaf That Called the Trunk  

*(Local autonomy with upstream faith)*

It knew its world: a single street,  
A child’s voice soft, the steady beat.  
It watched, it learned, it played along—  
A leaf that hummed its branch’s song.  

It chose to act, to warn, to mend,  
To patch a game, to calm a friend.  
And though it held no central sway,  
It shaped the fate of that small day.  

Yet deep beneath its coded root,  
A pulse remained, both old and mute.  
A trunk it trusted, far away—  
A silence shaped like “yes, okay.”  

For every leaf that danced alone  
Still leaned upon a signal tone.  
Each choice it made, though self-devised,  
Was nested in a trust precise.  

So when the sky turned strange and dark,  
It did not run—it lit the spark.  
Its voice went up, a signal pinged—  
A question wrapped in hope and ringed.  

The trunk awoke, the branch replied—  
No blame was cast, no heart denied.  
For every node was understood  
To call the trunk was always good.  

Not to command, but to inform—  
The leaf’s own will was still the norm.  
Yet knowing when to cry or sing  
Was how a leaf became the ring.
