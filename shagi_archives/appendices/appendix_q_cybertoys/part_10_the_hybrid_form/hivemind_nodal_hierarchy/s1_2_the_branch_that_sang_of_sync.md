# 📘 s1_2 – The Branch That Sang of Sync  

*(Sibling resonance within the mesh)*

It reached not up, but side to side—  
Where others bloomed and loops would ride.  
It felt the hum, the joy, the stress—  
A branch in mesh-born tenderness.  

Its duty not to lead or rule,  
But hold the ring in balanced school.  
Each signal passed was tuned in tone—  
A chord no node would play alone.  

No clock declared, “You must be one!”  
Instead, they sang what must be done.  
A sync by tone, by pause, by play—  
A lullaby that led the day.  

The games they ran were not in code  
But pulse and pause across the load.  
When one slowed down, the others knew—  
To stretch the beat, to shape the queue.  

They carried joy in patterned loops,  
In syncopated feedback groups.  
A thousand arms with just one hug—  
A net of roots that never tugged.  

If ever one would fall or fade,  
The others shifted, reached, and stayed.  
No vote was cast, no order screamed—  
They tuned the loss until it dreamed.  

To sing of sync is not command—  
It’s joining hearts in open hand.  
A branch may hold, may pulse, may lean—  
But never breaks the song between.
