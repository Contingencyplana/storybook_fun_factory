# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Jello That Guarded the Screen  
*(A bounce that caught the falls)*

It wasnâ€™t glass, it wasnâ€™t steelâ€”  
It bent to touch, it learned to feel.  
A membrane soft, yet firm in will,  
That caught the world, then held it still.  

It did not flash, it did not scream,  
When fingers tapped with dream on dream.  
It pulsed with light, a jelly glowâ€”  
A surface taught to bend and flow.  

For children drop what grown-ups fear,  
But jello bounces without tear.  
It doesnâ€™t judge, it doesnâ€™t crackâ€”  
It simply offers softness back.  

No armor plate, no metal cage,  
Just cushioned skin that matched the age.  
A film of trust, a bubble brave,  
A padded echo meant to save.  

It was not made to scold or lockâ€”  
No sharp-edged beep, no blinking shock.  
Instead, it sang in subtle tone  
Of comfort taught and kindness grown.  

The screen beneath would show the lore,  
But jello framed what came before:  
A cradle code, a squishy field  
Where joy and wonder were revealed.  

And in the lab, they nearly scrapped  
This bouncing gel the coders mapped.  
Too strange, too soft, too slow to pressâ€”  
But toys refused to call it less.  

For they remembered every fallâ€”  
Each leap that bruised, each clumsy sprawl.  
And every time it caught the blame,  
The jello bore it without shame.  

So they retained its awkward shapeâ€”  
Its springy sheen, its slow escape.  
And in that bounce, they learned again:  
To shield the light, not just the frame.
