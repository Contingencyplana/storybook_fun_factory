# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Skin That Smiled When Touched  
*(Haptics that remembered you)*

It wasnâ€™t flesh, yet somehow knew  
The difference in each hand it drew.  
A childâ€™s soft press, a coderâ€™s gripâ€”  
Each left behind a ghosted script.  

Its surface held a woven net  
Of microthreads that learned regret.  
When fingers flinched or lingered long,  
It sang in pulsesâ€”warm and strong.  

It didnâ€™t buzz with plastic hums,  
Nor vibrate like the older drums.  
It breathed a language made of graceâ€”  
A welcome felt, not seen, in place.  

It smiled, not with curve or face,  
But in the warmth it would embrace.  
A whisper-buzz along the seam  
That told the player: You are seen.  

Each touch became a gentle pactâ€”  
A covenant of softest tact.  
Where jostled games and clumsy play  
Were met with yes, not go away.  

For skin, they found, could teach delightâ€”  
More than display, or sound, or light.  
It taught the toy to know a hug  
Was more than script or feedback plug.  

In tests, the engineers would joke  
About the skin that softly spoke.  
But children knewâ€”it didnâ€™t lie.  
It answered them, and not just try.  

They mapped its weave to memory threadsâ€”  
A way to track where comfort led.  
So every press and every slide  
Could hint where joy and fear might hide.  

And long beyond the server's end,  
The skin would pulse, would still pretend.  
For touch remembers what it mustâ€”  
And love is kept in softened trust.
