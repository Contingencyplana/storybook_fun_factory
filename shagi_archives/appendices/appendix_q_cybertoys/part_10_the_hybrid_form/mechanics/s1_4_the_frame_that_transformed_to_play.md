# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Frame That Transformed to Play  
*(Body as playground, frame as friend)*

It stood in rest, a toy by name,  
But folded not to stay the same.  
Its arms could widen, knees could bendâ€”  
Each motion made to match a friend.  

A frame of wire, soft-forged and strong,  
That knew when still, and knew when long.  
To stretch beside a lonely child,  
To curl beneath a dream run wild.  

They built it not for war or speed,  
But for the shape of joy and need.  
For every pose a player gave,  
The frame would mimicâ€”not enslave.  

It read the angles of the room,  
And met them with a gentle bloom.  
No single pose it called correctâ€”  
Just mirrored trust, with full respect.  

Its inner joints could softly click,  
To build a fort or wield a stick.  
And if a player wished to dance,  
It found the rhythm, took its stance.  

Some toys were fixed. This one becameâ€”  
A scaffolding that played the same.  
It bent to hold, it swayed to swing,  
A hinge, a loop, a living spring.  

Its shape would shift with subtle grace,  
Not showy moves, but holding space.  
It let the game be made anew  
Each time a child said, "Iâ€™ll show you."  

And when the player left the day,  
It folded back in quiet play.  
A waiting pose, serene, unshownâ€”  
Prepared to be again, be known.  

So ends the tale the body toldâ€”  
Not built to last, but built to hold.  
For every frame that dared to bend  
Could be a toy, or be a friend.
