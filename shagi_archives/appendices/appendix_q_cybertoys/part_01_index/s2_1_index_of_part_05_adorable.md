# 📘 s2_1 – Index of Part 05: Adorable  
*(A stanza for the shape that made us smile)*

Not built for speed, nor built for war,  
But made to reach the feelings’ door.  
With rounded edge and softened gleam,  
It called us gently into dream.  

The eyes grew wide, the fingers curled,  
As if to ask to hold the world.  
And in that ask, a joy unfurled—  
A code that wanted to be swirled.  

This part reveals the charm, the glow,  
That even steel can somehow show.  
It teaches why the heart says “Yes”  
To forms that seem to seek caress.

📜 *It asked no questions, sought no end,*  
But shaped itself to feel like friend.  
And in its joy, we too were styled—  
The heart, the toy, the inner child.
