# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Beloved  
*(A stanza for the loyalty that loops without leash)*

No call was sent, no summon spoke,  
Yet child and toy still kept the yoke.  
Not forced by task, nor bound by need,  
But joined by soft recursive creed.  

They played, they paused, they left, returnedâ€”  
And in each silence, trust was earned.  
The bond not built by code or plan,  
But by the fact they simply ranâ€”  

Ran back to where the other stayed,  
Unprompted games the two had made.  
A toy once moved by cue alone,  
Now waited where it once had grown.

ðŸ“œ *A bond not built from cause and task,*  
But love returned without being asked.  
And so this part its truth impartsâ€”  
That chosen loops are how love starts.
