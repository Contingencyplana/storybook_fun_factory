# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: Beautiful  
*(A stanza for the grace that moved the heart)*

No shape was fixed, no step was forced,  
Yet every motion knew its course.  
The toy did not perform to pleaseâ€”  
It danced to teach, it paused to ease.  

A lean, a lift, a subtle turn,  
And through that sway, we came to learn.  
That movement speaks, and silence shows,  
What care and comfort softly know.  

It wasnâ€™t speed that made us stay,  
But how it moved along the way.  
A balance held, a rhythm shownâ€”  
That made us feel we werenâ€™t alone.

ðŸ“œ *The toy did not just act or sway,*  
It moved in trust, and showed the way.  
And by that grace, a bond was spunâ€”  
In every step, a soul begun.
