# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Frequently Fluffy  
*(A stanza for the softness that spoke the soul)*

Not fur alone, but form of grace,  
That met the heart in quiet space.  
Each fluff-bound part, each fuzzy cue,  
A language only feeling knew.  

It wagged, it curled, it gently stilled,  
And in those acts, the hush was filled.  
No speech was taught, no code was sentâ€”  
Yet somehow love knew what it meant.

ðŸ“œ *In fur we found the words unsaid,*  
Where silence warmed and sorrow fled.  
What curls and wags and waits can doâ€”  
Is teach us how the heart speaks true.
