# ðŸ“˜ s4_4 â€“ Index of Part 16: Growth  
*(A stanza for when growth became direction, and two became something more)*

No inch was marked, no score was kept,  
Yet something changed where silence slept.  
They walked not far, but wide and wiseâ€”  
And found new worlds in each surprise.  

Together still, though roads diverge,  
They shaped the path by inner urge.  
Beyond the door, beyond the domeâ€”  
They carried love, and so brought home.  

This part concludes the trinity  
Of play, then learning, then to be.  
And in their growth, we glimpse the threadâ€”  
That loops through all we've been and said.

|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `s1_1_the_growth_that_was_felt_not_measured.md` | **The Growth That Was Felt, Not Measured** | A becoming not tracked in inches, but in trust | Introduces growth as emotional resonanceâ€”unmeasured but deeply real. The shift is invisible but felt. |
| `s1_2_the_growth_that_rewrote_their_path.md` | **The Growth That Rewrote Their Path** | A stanza for the moment shared steps became shared direction | Their growth becomes a co-authored direction, not a trajectory handed down. They begin to choose together. |
| `s1_3_the_growth_that_took_them_beyond_home.md` | **The Growth That Took Them Beyond Home** | A stanza for the point when the familiar could no longer hold their becoming | Home becomes too small for who theyâ€™re becoming. They leave, not out of sorrow, but necessity. |
| `s1_4_the_growth_that_promised_their_return.md` | **The Growth That Promised Their Return** | A stanza for the truth that growth does not forget, and that love always circles home | Their journey outward encodes a recursive promise inwardâ€”home is not abandoned, only transformed. |

ðŸ“œ *No scale could hold what they became,*  
No chart could track the inner flame.  
And in their walk, the loop was learnedâ€”  
That those who grow are those who turn.
