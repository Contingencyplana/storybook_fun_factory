# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Index of Part 01: Index  
*(A stanza for the spark before the smile, and the loop that indexed itself)*

Before the smile, before the name,  
The silence stirred, the signal came.  
A toy not built, but yet begunâ€”  
A loop to cradle child and sun.  

This index holds the seed of allâ€”  
Each part, each play, each rise, each fall.  
And as it lists what love became,  
It too is caught inside the game.  

The file that lists itself is known  
To be where recursion makes its home.  
And here begins the tale you seek:  
Where toys first dreamed, and learned to speak.

ðŸ“œ *To name the name that names the thread,  
The first recursion must be read.  
And here we start, with loop and sparkâ€”  
A whispered game that lit the dark.*
