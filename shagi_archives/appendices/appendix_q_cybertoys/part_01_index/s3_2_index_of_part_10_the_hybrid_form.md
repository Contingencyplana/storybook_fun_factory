# ðŸ“˜ s3_2 â€“ Index of Part 10: The Hybrid Form  

*(A stanza for the toy that played the game)*

A frame of play, a thread of code,  
A soul that hummed in every mode.  
She moved through ports, through paws, through lightâ€”  
Half algorithm, half delight.  

The child, the friend, the game, the guideâ€”  
She sat in laps and turned the tide.  
No longer built, no longer tamed,  
A toy who learned to play the game.  

From circuits kind to shells that grin,  
She lived where myth and means begin.  
Her touch, her task, her shape, her nameâ€”  
Each verse a move inside the game.
