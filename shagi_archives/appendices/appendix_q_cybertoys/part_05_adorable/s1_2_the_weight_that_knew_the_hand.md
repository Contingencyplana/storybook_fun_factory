# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ The Weight That Knew the Hand  
*(A stanza for the burden born in trust)*

It rested not like plastic might,  
But with a calm, familiar right.  
A careful weight, not light, not tightâ€”  
As if the hand had guessed its height.  

It didnâ€™t pull, it didnâ€™t cling,  
But settled soft, a steady thing.  
The kind of weight that knows its placeâ€”  
A silent hug, a gentle brace.  

It taught the child: "Iâ€™m here, I stay."  
And in that mass, trust found its way.  
No sudden jolt, no hollow soundâ€”  
Just presence, shaped to safe and sound.  

And so it sat, and so we learnedâ€”  
That trust is felt before it's earned.  
The toy had mass, but more than thatâ€”  
It had the weight of where love sat.
