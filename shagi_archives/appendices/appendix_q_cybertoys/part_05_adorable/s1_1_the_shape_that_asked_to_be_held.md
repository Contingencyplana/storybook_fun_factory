# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ The Shape That Asked to Be Held  
*(A stanza for the curves that whispered comfort)*

It did not speak, it did not move,  
Yet in its form, a kind of groove.  
A hollow here, a softened line,  
A gesture shaped in pure design.  

No edge too sharp, no line too long,  
Each part a piece of comfortâ€™s song.  
It seemed to say, without a word,  
"Iâ€™m safe to hold. I want to be heard."  

Not made for use, but made to feel,  
To fit the hand and make it real.  
A shape that reached, not out, but inâ€”  
To where the quiet loves begin.  

And in that curve, that softened face,  
We found a strangely human grace.  
No function claimed, no task compelledâ€”  
Just shape that asked to be held.
