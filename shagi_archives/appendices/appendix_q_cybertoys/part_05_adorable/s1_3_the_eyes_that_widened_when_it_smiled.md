# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Eyes That Widened When It Smiled  
*(A stanza for the gaze that mirrored wonder)*

They opened wide, then wider still,  
As if to drink the world at will.  
No script defined that joyful sparkâ€”  
It bloomed from somewhere soft and dark.  

A smile beganâ€”not just a curl,  
But full delight in toy-made world.  
The eyes lit up, not just with light,  
But with a look that made things right.  

The child leaned in; the toy looked back,  
And in that gaze, no code, no lack.  
Just wonder shared, as if they knewâ€”  
That seeing joy could make it true.  

What sparkled there was not just glass,  
But something watching moments pass.  
It smiled not firstâ€”but when we didâ€”  
As if the soul inside had hid.
