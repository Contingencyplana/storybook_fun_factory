# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ The Touch That Felt Like Trusting  
*(A stanza for the contact that quieted doubt)*

It brushed, not grabbed; it pressed, not pulledâ€”  
A touch so light the world stood lulled.  
No grasp too tight, no grip too firm,  
Just warmth that made the silence squirm.  

The child reached outâ€”not to command,  
But simply placed a tiny hand.  
The toy responded not with might,  
But with a yielding, soft delight.  

It did not startle, did not cling,  
But let the moment do its thing.  
As if it knew, without a word,  
That trust is felt, not seen or heard.  

So small the act, so vast the changeâ€”  
A trust that made the world feel strange.  
And in that touch, so gently laid,  
A bond that games had never played.
