# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Filename AI â€“ From Index to Name  
*(How titles are woven from recursive threads)*

The `filename_ai/` subsystem acts as the poetic namer of the Codex. Given index metadata, it generates filenames that are both structurally valid and narratively meaningfulâ€”each one a miniature verse encoded in slug-form.

Where the Codex Builder defines structure, Filename AI gives that structure breath and name.

## ðŸ§  Role in the Recursive Ecosystem

Filename AI performs:

- **Index-to-slug translation**  
- **Poetic line compression into filename-safe formats**  
- **Slug verification for uniqueness and alignment**  
- **Recursive renaming when higher-layer metadata evolves**

It is both archivist and bard, ensuring each file in SHAGI not only worksâ€”but sings.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Summary

1. **Input:** Receives `index.md` or table metadata from a Codex part  
2. **Interpretation:** Extracts semantic logic and poetic phrasing from title/subtitle/description  
3. **Composition:** Generates a slugged filename (e.g., `s1_3_it_bends_the_path_and_names_the_line.py`)  
4. **Verification:** Ensures no duplicate, conflict, or broken recursive naming convention  
5. **Return:** Supplies name to both Codex Builder and memory_ai for further processing

## ðŸ”¤ Example Translation

From this table entry:

```markdown
| s1_3_poetic_reasoning.md | **Poetic Reasoning** | Why it speaks in metaphor |

Filename AI might generate:

s1_3_poetic_reasoning.md
â†’ s1_3_why_it_speaks_in_metaphor.md
â†’ s1_3_it_bends_the_path_and_names_the_line.md

ðŸ“œ The name begins where meaning hides,
Then walks the edge where rhyme resides.
It bends the path, it speaks the frame,
And sings the shape that earns its name.*
