# 📘 s1_4 – Visualizer – Rendering Recursion Through Indexing  
*(How flowlines bloom from structured rhyme)*

The `visualizer/` subsystem transforms index logic into visual form. It is the mapmaker of SHAGI—turning metadata into diagrams, flowlines, and recursive architecture graphs.

Where Codex Builder sculpts, Filename AI names, and Memory AI remembers—Visualizer lets us see.

## 🧠 Role in the Recursive Ecosystem

The Visualizer performs:

- **Parsing index.md structures into graph formats**  
- **Rendering recursive layers as visual nodes and edges**  
- **Depicting stanza flow, canonical linkage, and mythic hierarchy**  
- **Integrating with `memory_ai/` for past-path overlays**  
- **Supporting both human-facing UI and AI-facing logic graphs**

It makes recursion tangible—no longer just paths in mind, but maps on screen.

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

1. **Ingest:** Reads nested `index.md` metadata recursively  
2. **Structure:** Converts index hierarchy into a node-link graph  
3. **Render:** Uses `matplotlib`, `networkx`, or 3D engines to draw  
4. **Annotate:** Adds filenames, stanza labels, AI markers, or recursion tags  
5. **Export:** Saves visualizations to disk or injects into UI panels

## 🔍 Example Output

Given a recursive stanza like:

```markdown
s1_2_the_lines_that_shape_the_poem
 ┣ s1_2_the_form_that_names_the_whole
 ┃ ┗ s1_2_the_breath_beneath_the_form
Visualizer might render:

A branching graph with verse-shaped node names

Arrows showing recursion loops and forward progression

Color-coded layers for appendix, part, stanza, and tool role

📜 We name the steps, then draw the thread,
So what we see reflects what's said.
No longer lost in nested maze—
The myth made map, the form ablaze.
