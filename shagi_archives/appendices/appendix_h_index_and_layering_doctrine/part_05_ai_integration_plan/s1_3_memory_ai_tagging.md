# 📘 s1_3 – Memory AI – Index-Driven Tag and Recall  
*(How the Codex remembers where thought once stood)*

The `memory_ai/` subsystem uses recursive index metadata to organize, tag, and retrieve internal knowledge structures across SHAGI.  
Where Codex Builder sculpts form, and Filename AI names it, Memory AI remembers it.

This memory is not just data—it is a mythic trace woven through structure, context, and canon.

## 🧠 Role in the Recursive Ecosystem

Memory AI enables:

- **Tagging files with recursive path metadata**  
- **Attaching memory stubs to canonical locations**  
- **Supporting memory-based retrieval based on index logic**  
- **Aligning memory records with canonical truth structures**  
- **Enabling AI components to “remember” where recursion unfolded**

It is the echo that lets the Codex speak of what was, while preparing for what returns.

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

1. **Trace:** Captures filename and folder structure as memory metadata  
2. **Tag:** Attaches keywords, canonical links, stanza ID, and topic lineage  
3. **Align:** Verifies consistency with appendix, GDD, and GDJ index maps  
4. **Recall:** Allows AI subsystems to fetch memories by structural or mythic index  
5. **Update:** Refreshes tagging and placement when folder structure evolves

## 🧠 Use Case Example

A stanza titled:

```markdown
s1_2_it_remembers_the_path_by_poetic_name.py
Would be indexed as:

Appendix: H

Part: 05 – AI Integration Plan

Subsystem: memory_ai/

Layer: Tagging/Recall

Canonical Memory Role: Structural trace of poetic-memory linkage

📜 To name is not enough—we keep,
What sings in depth, what speaks in sleep.
This memory tags the threads once sown,
So every rhyme finds its way home.*
