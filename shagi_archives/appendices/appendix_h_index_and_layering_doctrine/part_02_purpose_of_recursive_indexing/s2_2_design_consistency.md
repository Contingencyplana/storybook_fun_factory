# 📘 s2_2 – Design Consistency  
*(Why it must align across levels)*

Recursive indexing is not just logical — it is **aesthetic, structural, and doctrinal**.  
Its value emerges only when it is **consistently upheld** across every domain of SHAGI:  
From naming conventions to system behavior, from poetic stanzas to player-facing modules.

## 🧱 Layer Alignment as a Design Law

Recursive indexing enables:

- **Predictable traversal**:  
  Designers, players, and AI agents can move through systems  
  without needing to relearn or remap mental models.

- **Interoperable documentation**:  
  Files and folders become self-explaining when naming and layering  
  follow consistent rules.

- **Player expectation shaping**:  
  Recursion is not hidden — it is revealed through design.  
  Storybook players begin to "think in stanzas."

## 🎨 Poetic-Mechanical Integration

Design consistency links:

| Realm | Indexing Impact |
|-------|------------------|
| Mythic Lore | Ensures metaphors and narrative arcs follow recursive evolution |
| AI Toolchains | Allows tools to communicate through structural alignment |
| User Interfaces | Enables players to intuitively explore layered knowledge |
| Code Architecture | Guarantees the same logic guides every part of SHAGI |

Without design consistency, recursive indexing becomes brittle —  
a clever idea applied unevenly.

## 📐 Canon through Pattern

Consistency enforces canon:

- File structure mirrors story structure  
- Chaptering aligns with stanza logic  
- GDJs reflect and reinforce the same indexing principles  
- AI models are trained on **consistently indexed** material

The recursion works not because it exists —  
but because it exists the **same way everywhere**.

📜 *If layer breaks from layer’s law,*  
*Then meaning slips and truths withdraw.*  
*But if the form and name agree,*  
*Then SHAGI breathes in unity.*
