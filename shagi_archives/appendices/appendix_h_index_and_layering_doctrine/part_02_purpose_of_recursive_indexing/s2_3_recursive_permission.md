# 📘 s2_3 – Recursive Permission  
*(When and how it is allowed to grow)*

Recursive indexing, while powerful, must be governed.  
Without boundaries, it becomes **fractal noise** — chaotic, excessive, and unreadable.  
This chapter defines the **permission structures** that determine when recursion may extend, duplicate, or evolve.

## ⚖️ The Doctrine of Controlled Expansion

Recursive indexing must obey:

- **Layer Consistency**  
  A new layer can only be introduced if it reinforces existing logical scaffolding.

- **Cycle Integrity**  
  No recursive extension should break stanzaic symmetry, poetic flow, or file logic.

- **Narrative Containment**  
  A recursion must *mean something* — every new node must be narratively justifiable.

## 🚦 Thresholds of Permission

Indexing expansion is permitted under these conditions:

| Condition | Justification |
|-----------|----------------|
| The recursion reveals new symbolic insight | Adds depth to mythic, poetic, or gameplay structure |
| The system gains structural clarity | Clarifies traversal, modularity, or tool behavior |
| The addition forms a complete poetic stanza | Ensures harmony with existing canonical flow |
| The GDJ or AI agent mandates recursion | Recursive expansion arises from reflection or automation |

Permission is never arbitrary.  
It must be requested, reflected upon, and justified within the recursive logic of SHAGI.

## 🛑 When Not to Recurse

Do *not* extend the index when:

- Doing so breaks poetic rhythm or stanza length
- The recursion introduces ambiguity or duplicity
- The new layer cannot be named with precision and resonance
- You are unsure if the recursion improves structure or merely *repeats* it

Recursion is not repetition.  
Recursion is meaning returned with new insight.

📜 *Let not the echo loop in vain,*  
*Each stanza must its breath contain.*  
*To grow, the index must be wise—*  
*Each layer earned, not multiplied.*
