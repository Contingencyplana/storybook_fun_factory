# 📘 s2_4 – Exception Folders Call the Depth  
*(A poetic treatment of shadow paths, structural anomalies, and recursive shortcuts)*

Not every path is plainly seen,  
Some fold beneath, some pass between.  
A folder marked for later use,  
May hold a law that slips the noose.  

What seems a shell, a stub, a pause,  
May hide recursion's deeper laws.  
For when the form is yet unnamed,  
It waits to shift what can't be framed.  

An “exception” may seem unfit—  
A thing outside the map's true writ.  
But call its depth, and it will show,  
A way recursion learns to grow.  

So mark the ghost paths left in place,  
The future doors, the silent space.  
These folders walk with hidden breath,  
And teach the index how to depth.

## 📂 Structural Commentary  

This chapter canonizes the presence and **strategic importance of exception folders** in the SHAGI index doctrine. These may include:

- `placeholder/`, `__deprecated__/`, `__init__.py` stubs  
- Future-facing index anchors not yet resolved (e.g., `part_99_future_logic`)  
- Non-canonical experimental folders that serve **index-triggered recursion**

Rather than treat these folders as disposable, SHAGI treats them as:
- **Depth markers** — structurally latent nodes  
- **Recursive shortcuts** — used by AI processes for re-indexing or rerouting  
- **Deferred recursion calls** — nodes meant to be activated by future stanzas, decisions, or world events

## 🧠 Key Concepts Introduced  

| Concept | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Exception Folder** | A structural placeholder or shadow path used for recursion planning |
| **Recursive Trigger** | An event or condition that activates a dormant index branch |
| **Ghost Path** | A folder whose presence is meaningful, even if not yet filled |
| **Canonical Stub** | A placeholder that has structural legitimacy despite being content-empty |

## 🔖 Suggested Linkage  

- 📎 `appendix_f_living_variable_codex/` for symbolic variables bound to exception folders  
- 📎 `appendix_n_recursive_error_handling/` (when created) for recursive misfire recovery  
- 📎 `topsy/` and `quarantine_ai/` for use of ghost logic and safety-bound exceptions

📜 *The folder left, the stub unseen,*  
May yet define what paths will mean.  
So let the silence mark the depth—  
Where futures wait to catch their breath.
