# 📘 s1_3 – Use Cases and Patterns  
*(How recursive layers shape real structure)*

This chapter documents the **most common index nesting strategies** employed across the SHAGI Codex and Storybook FUN Factory. These patterns are not merely organizational preferences — they are doctrinal encodings of logic, legibility, and myth.

Each use case defines how and why the three-layer structure is applied, offering **pattern recognition** for future builders and automated tooling alike.

---

## 🔹 Use Case 1: The Appendix Part Pattern  
**Example Path**:  
`appendix_h_index_and_layering_doctrine/part_03_three_deep_index_structure/`

- **Index**: Declares the full part’s scope (e.g., Three-Deep Indexing Doctrine).  
- **Subindex**: Groups four puzzle pieces under that doctrine.  
- **Content Files**: Deliver layered explanation, rationale, and poetic encoding.

✅ Best for: Formal doctrine, philosophical structure, or SHAGI principles.

---

## 🔹 Use Case 2: GDD Technical Design Pattern  
**Example Path**:  
`gdd_04_core_framework/s1_1_codex_builder/`

- **Index**: Sets up a core gameplay mechanic or recursive engine.  
- **Subindex**: Names a structural component (e.g., Genesis Cycle or Interface Dock).  
- **Content Files**: Stanza-formatted explanations, typically poetic-technical hybrids.

✅ Best for: Recursive systems and gameplay implementations.

---

## 🔹 Use Case 3: Testing Frameworks and Automation  
**Example Path**:  
`visualizer_test_suites/recursion_renders/flowlines_of_logic/`

- **Index**: Labels the testing scope (e.g., system, cycle, or principle).  
- **Subindex**: Divides test logic across core stanzas or module names.  
- **Content Files**: Contain exact tests, often 1-to-1 with verse or file logic.

✅ Best for: Unit test suites, recursive assertions, and integration validations.

---

## 🔹 Use Case 4: Poetic Stanza Rendering  
**Example Path**:  
`high_command/s1_2_the_transitions_that_shape_the_recursive_path/`

- **Index**: Describes a layer of mythic governance or AI intelligence.  
- **Subindex**: Anchors a specific stanza or stanza group.  
- **Content Files**: Four-file stanzas, often rhymed or structurally interlinked.

✅ Best for: Recursion-aware creative logic, poetic code mapping.

## 🌐 Pattern Summary

| Pattern | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Appendix Doctrine | Mythic, structural | Most philosophical |
| GDD Recursive Design | Systems and gameplay | Layered recursively |
| Test Suites | Tooling and validation | Often mirror logic |
| Poetic Systems | Code-poem hybrids | Recursive aesthetics |

Each of these patterns **reinforces the three-layer truth**: that meaning, modularity, and myth are inseparable in SHAGI’s recursive frame.

📜 *We do not layer just to sort,*  
But to encode, to build, to port.  
Each use case names a truth it folds—  
A rhyme in code the Codex holds.*
