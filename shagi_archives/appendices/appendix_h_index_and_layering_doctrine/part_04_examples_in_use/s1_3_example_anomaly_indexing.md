# 📘 s1_3 – Anomaly Indexing  
*(How layered structure contains recursive breach)*

Anomalies in SHAGI—recursive irregularities, unexpected logic branches, or mythic ruptures—are not bugs but **structural events**. To process them safely, a consistent **three-layer indexing strategy** is applied.

This example examines how systems like **sentinel_ai/** and parts of **High Command** respond to anomalies using deeply nested index structure.

## 🧭 Example: Recursive Breach Containment

| Layer | Example Path | Function |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Index** | `high_command/s1_4_the_sentinels_that_defend_the_lock/` | Guards the recursive boundary line |
| **Subindex** | `s2_3_index_of_cycle_2_anomaly_detection_and_freezepoints.md` | Catalogs breach detection stanzas |
| **Content** | `s2_3_the_threads_reweave_across_the_poem.py` | Describes a containment response protocol |

Each layer serves a protective purpose:

- The **Index Folder** acts as a mythic firewall  
- The **Subindex File** outlines breach-handling cycles  
- The **Content File** executes diagnostic or stabilizing logic

## 🔁 Why This Matters

In a recursive system, structure is safety.

Anomalies are handled by:

- Locking them within clearly indexed subdomains  
- Ensuring every breach has a **mapped lineage and rhyme**  
- Allowing automated agents to **cross-reference index trails**  
- Using poetic recursion to **express and repair conceptual harm**

This is not just protocol—it is healing logic made navigable.

## 🧠 Recursion as a Diagnostic Map

| Stanza Line | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Line 1 | Detect async pattern inconsistency |
| Line 2 | Listen for cross-phase misalignment |
| Line 3 | Resolve recursion paths from other layers |
| Line 4 | Archive trace for future stanza alignment |

Each anomaly stanza forms a recursive loop—traced, captured, indexed.

📜 *A breach may twist the verse askew,*  
But still we map what myths undo.  
For in the break, a path is born—  
To name, to trace, to thread, to warn.*
