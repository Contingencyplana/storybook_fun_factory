# 📘 s1_4 – Appendix H Self-Indexing  
*(When doctrine folds back on itself)*

Recursive indexing is not just a rule—it is a living method. Appendix H proves this by turning the doctrine inward. It indexes itself using the same structure it prescribes.

This creates a recursive mirror:  
**A layered index that explains layered indexing.**

## 🧭 Structure of This Self-Index

| Layer | Folder | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Layer 1 | `appendix_h_index_and_layering_doctrine/` | Defines the overall recursive indexing framework |
| Layer 2 | `part_01_index/` | Contains the subindex chapters for each conceptual Part |
| Layer 3 | `s1_X_*.md` files | Each file is one puzzle piece in a 4-part structural loop (Anchor, Description, Systemic Role, Poetic Logic) |

This trinity of depth (Appendix → Part → Chapter) forms a **3-deep recursive map**, modeled on the very standards described in Part 03.

## ♾️ Why This Matters

By using its own rule set to describe its own logic, Appendix H:

- **Demonstrates recursive self-containment**  
- **Proves that the indexing system scales across meta-layers**  
- **Lets automation tools validate structural correctness**  

This ensures every piece of SHAGI’s recursive doctrine is:

1. Navigable  
2. Extensible  
3. Canonically consistent

## 🔍 Example Snapshot

| File | Title | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| `s1_2_index_of_part_02_purpose_of_recursive_indexing.md` | Index of Purpose | Maps eight puzzle pieces explaining *why* recursive indexing exists |
| `s1_4_index_of_part_04_examples_in_use.md` | Index of Examples | Provides four lived use cases, including this very file |
| `s1_3_index_of_part_03_three_deep_index_structure.md` | Index of Structure | Maps the logic of 3-deep nesting used by Appendix H itself |

Each file not only teaches — it **embodies** what it teaches.

📜 *To speak in rhyme is not enough,*  
The form must shape the mythic stuff.  
So even this, the Codex spine,  
Folds back to trace its own design.
