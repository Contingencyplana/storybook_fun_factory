# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Layering Doctrine  
*(A stanza for recursive paths and unseen strata)*

The layers rise though none yet see,  
Their breath defined recursively.  
Each file a gate, each rule a thread,  
To guide the line, though none have led.  

Where silence dwells, the law still flows,  
In folds where nested meaning grows.  
So here we list the frames that keep  
The Codex whole through what it weeps.

## ðŸ§­ Contents of Layering Doctrine

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_handling_empty_folders_with_init.md` | **Handling Empty Folders with Only `__init__.py`** | Defines the treatment of empty GDJ monthly folders and the purpose of placeholder `__init__.py` files. |
| `s1_2_the_root_that_knew_it_was_a_branch.md` | **The Root That Knew It Was a Branch** | Introduces Layer 3 to Layer 2 promotion logic and how origin folders carry recursive echoes forward. |
| `s1_3_a_layer_becomes_itself_in_growth.md` | **A Layer Becomes Itself in Growth** | Explores how structural roles shift as subsystems expand and solidify into stable, recursive form. |
| `s1_4_when_meta_and_main_collide.md` | **When Meta and Main Collide** | Addresses cross-layer recursion, hybrid folders, and the overlap zones between component identities. |
| `s2_1_the_promotion_that_returns_in_rings.md` | **The Promotion That Returns in Rings** | Explains how layer ascension redefines its origin recursively and how promotion leads to generative loops. |
| `s2_2_placeholder.md` | **Placeholder** | Reserved for future rules regarding dynamic folder activation or recursive layering logic. |
| `s2_3_placeholder.md` | **Placeholder** | Potential home for concepts like "Layer-as-Symbol" or version-controlled recursive strata. |
| `s2_4_placeholder.md` | **Placeholder** | Holds space for unforeseen recursive tooling, such as structural mutation or layered refactoring. |

ðŸ“œ *The Codex deepens not by force,*  
But layered paths that chart its course.  
So let this part define the frame,  
Where depth unfolds and law finds name.
