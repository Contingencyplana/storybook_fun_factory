# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Layering Doctrine  
*(A stanza for recursive paths and unseen strata)*

The layers rise though none yet see,  
Their breath defined recursively.  
Each file a gate, each rule a thread,  
To guide the line, though none have led.

Where silence dwells, the law still flows,  
In folds where nested meaning grows.  
So here we list the frames that keep  
The Codex whole through what it weeps.

## ðŸ§­ Contents of Layering Doctrine

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_handling_empty_folders_with_init.md` | **Handling Empty Folders with Only `__init__.py`** | Defines the treatment of empty GDJ monthly folders and the purpose of placeholder `__init__.py` files. |
| `s1_2_placeholder.md` | **Placeholder** | Reserved for future rules regarding dynamic folder activation or recursive layering logic. |
| `s1_3_placeholder.md` | **Placeholder** | Potential home for concepts like "Layer-as-Symbol" or version-controlled recursive strata. |
| `s1_4_placeholder.md` | **Placeholder** | Holds space for unforeseen recursive tooling, such as structural mutation or layered refactoring. |

ðŸ“œ *The Codex deepens not by force,*  
But layered paths that chart its course.  
So let this part define the frame,  
Where depth unfolds and law finds name.
