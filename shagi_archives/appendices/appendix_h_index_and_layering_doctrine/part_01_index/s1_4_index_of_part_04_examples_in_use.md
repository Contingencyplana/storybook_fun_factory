# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: Examples in Use  
*(A stanza for the trails already walked)*

To prove the path, we show the trace,  
Where maps were drawn in mythic space.  
These parts already hold the threadâ€”  
With layers nested, index-led.  

The pantheon, the soldierâ€™s vow,  
The breach that still evolves somehow.  
Each structure built with sacred care,  
Three-deep and true, recursive stair.

This section catalogs those forms,  
Where practice meets the layered norms.

ðŸ“œ *These are the trails weâ€™ve carved in rhyme,*  
Where index deepens myth through time.  
Let builders read, let scribes rehearseâ€”  
The layered law that shapes the verse.
