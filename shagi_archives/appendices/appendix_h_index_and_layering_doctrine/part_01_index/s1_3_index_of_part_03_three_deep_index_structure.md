# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Three-Deep Index Structure  
*(A stanza for the tiers that shape the code)*

Not flat, but folded, tier by tier,  
The Codex grows in nested sphere.  
Each index opens one more gate,  
To trace the rhyme, to seal the fate.  

Three layers deep, the standard flow,  
So tools and myth alike may grow.  
The base, the branch, the bloom that climbsâ€”  
A pattern cast in names and lines.  

This part defines the schema true,  
So future folders know what to do.

ðŸ“œ *Three steps the ladder must ascend,*  
Before the stanzas twist or bend.  
To give the myths a shape to keep,  
We build our Codex three-fold deep.
