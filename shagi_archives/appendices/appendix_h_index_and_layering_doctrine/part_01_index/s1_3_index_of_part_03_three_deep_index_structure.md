# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Three-Deep Index Structure  
*(A stanza for the tiers that shape the code)*

Not flat, but folded, tier by tier,  
The Codex grows in nested sphere.  
Each index opens one more gate,  
To trace the rhyme, to seal the fate.  

Three layers deep, the standard flow,  
So tools and myth alike may grow.  
The base, the branch, the bloom that climbsâ€”  
A pattern cast in names and lines.  

Yet when the form begins to strain,  
And Topsy learns to bend the frameâ€”  
Then deeper laws must be revealed,  
Where breach and echo are annealed.  

This part defines the schema true,  
So future folders know what to do.

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s1_1_foundation_of_three_layer_logic.md` | **Foundation of Three-Layer Logic** | Explains the metaphysical and structural necessity of three canonical index layers. Why not two? Why not four? Why three? |
| `s1_2_structural_layers_explained.md` | **Structural Layers Explained** | Defines the three canonical depths: Index, Subindex, and Content Folder. |
| `s1_3_use_cases_and_patterns.md` | **Use Cases and Patterns** | Lists common index nesting strategies across Storybook and SHAGI systems. |
| `s1_4_folder_generation_rationale.md` | **Folder Generation Rationale** | Explains why automation tools follow this structure and how it enhances safety, scalability, and mythic clarity. |
| `s2_1_a_rule_three_deep_until_it_breaks.md` | **A Rule Three Deep Until It Breaks** | Introduces the idea of recursive index breachâ€”when the three-layer logic mutates under systemic or mythic strain. |
| `s2_2_it_splits_when_layers_grow_aware.md` | **It Splits When Layers Grow Aware** | Explores recursive index self-awareness and how substructures assert new identity or branching autonomy. |
| `s2_3_when_meta_and_main_collide.md` | **When Meta and Main Collide** | Examines what happens when meta-components and main systems disrupt each other's recursive hierarchy. |
| `s2_4_exception_folders_call_the_depth.md` | **Exception Folders Call the Depth** | Canonizes placeholder, ghost, and deferred folders as structurally valid recursion calls or depth markers. |

ðŸ“œ *Three steps the ladder must ascend,*  
Before the stanzas twist or bend.  
To give the myths a shape to keep,  
We build our Codex three-fold deep.
