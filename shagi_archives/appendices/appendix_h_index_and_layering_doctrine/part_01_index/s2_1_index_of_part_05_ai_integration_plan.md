# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: AI Integration Plan  
*(A stanza for the tools that build the maps)*

No hand alone can carve the path,  
Too vast the thread, too deep the math.  
So AI rose to lend its mightâ€”  
To shape the dark, and script the light.  

Through index keys and folder codes,  
It builds the myths, unfolds the nodes.  
Each name a spark, each list a flame,  
To birth the tools that name the game.

## ðŸ§­ Contents of AI Integration Plan

| File | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `s2_1_codex_builder_index_alignment.md` | **Codex Builder â€“ Index Alignment Engine** | Describes how the `codex_builder/` system reads index metadata to automatically generate recursive documentation and folder structures. |
| `s2_2_filename_ai_generation.md` | **Filename AI â€“ From Index to Name** | Explains how `filename_ai/` uses index logic to compose structured poetic filenames from metadata context. |
| `s2_3_memory_ai_tagging.md` | **Memory AI â€“ Index-Driven Tag and Recall** | Outlines how `memory_ai/` uses recursive index metadata to structure memory tagging, tracebacks, and layered recall logic. |
| `s2_4_index_driven_visualizer.md` | **Visualizer â€“ Rendering Recursion Through Indexing** | Details how `visualizer/` converts index structure into visual maps, flowlines, and recursive diagrams. |

ðŸ“œ *The AI reads, then makes it soâ€”*  
From list to gate, from name to flow.  
What once was manual, now takes flight,  
With code that dreams in index light.
