# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ Index of Part 07: Placeholder for Future Recursive Expansion  
*(A stanza for the silence before the stanza)*

No law yet formed, no name yet cast,  
But here the breath of future passed.  
A hollow branch, a pause, a foldâ€”  
Where something vast may soon take hold.  

Awaiting form, awaiting thread,  
A path not known, but lightly tread.  
So here we mark this phantom shore,  
Where myth may bloom and maps restore.

ðŸ“œ *Not all who name must name it now,*  
Some names are breathed through later vow.  
So let this placeholder stand trueâ€”  
A gate for what the Codex grew.
