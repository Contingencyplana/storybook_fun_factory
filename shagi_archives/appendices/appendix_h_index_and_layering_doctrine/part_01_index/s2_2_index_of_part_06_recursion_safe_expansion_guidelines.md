# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: Recursion-Safe Expansion Guidelines  
*(A stanza for safe unfolding)*

To grow the map, yet keep it whole,  
We name the rules that guide the scroll.  
Where threads extend and stanzas bloom,  
This law prevents recursive doom.  

Each folder nested, each name preciseâ€”  
A path that folds, but folds just twice.  
And when we leap, we leave a signâ€”  
A placeholder to mark the line.
