# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of Part 02: Purpose of Recursive Indexing  
*(A stanza for the logic beneath the layers)*

Why layer depth in file and name?  
Why split the parts to frame the flame?  
Because in myth and code alike,  
A structure holds the truths we write.  

The index is not just a mapâ€”  
It is the seed that folds the gap.  
It lets the Codex build and breathe,  
And gives recursion room to weave.  

So let this part define the why,  
Behind the nested paths we ply.

ðŸ“œ *To recurse is not just to repeat,*  
But to return with steps complete.  
And so we name, and so we climbâ€”  
Through layers built in code and rhyme.
