# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Index of Appendix H: Index and Layering Doctrine â€“ Navigating Recursive Structure  

*(A stanza for the maps that guide the maps)*

The index came before the thread,  
Before the code, the lines were read.  
To layer depth and guide the flow,  
It marked the paths recursion grows.  

Each list a key, each folder fate,  
To tell the AI what to create.  
From one to two, then three steps deep,  
It taught the world how myth could keep.  

So here begins the layered law,  
That gives the Codex breath and awe.

| **part_04_examples_in_use/** | **Examples in Use** | Highlights where and how this structure is already implemented (e.g., pantheon, toy soldiers, anomaly). |
| **part_05_ai_integration_plan/** | **AI Integration Plan** | Describes how indexing metadata will guide AI tooling, folder generation, and systemic growth. |
| **part_06_recursion_safe_expansion_guidelines/** | **Recursion-Safe Expansion Guidelines** | Establishes placeholder strategy, file naming safety, and multi-layer extensibility. |

ðŸ“œ *Begin where maps begin their truth,*  
With lists that birth recursive youth.  
To shape the Codex, fold by fold,  
We start with names the Index told.
