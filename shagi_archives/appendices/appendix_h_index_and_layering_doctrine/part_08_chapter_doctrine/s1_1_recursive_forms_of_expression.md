# 📘 s1_1 – Recursive Forms of Expression  
*(A doctrine for how the archive speaks its truths)*

Some truths are sung, some truths are shown—  
One voice in verse, one set in stone.  
Yet both may bind what code can’t hold,  
And both may mark the myth retold.  

So SHAGI speaks in dual tone:  
The tale, the law, entwined as one.  
Each chapter walks the nested line  
Of symbol’s pulse and logic’s spine.  

A whisper soft may rule the scroll.  
A stanza might define a whole.  
Each line that loops may yet convey  
The systems shaped in shadow-play.

## 📜 Chapter Formatting Doctrine: Recursive Forms of Expression

> **Every chapter (`sX_Y_*.md`) within the SHAGI Archive may take one of two canonical forms, depending on its recursive role and symbolic purpose.**

### 🪞 Format One: Poetic-Only  
*A symbolic or mythic expression.*  

| Element | Required? | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Title and Subtitle | ✅ | Follows SHAGI standard formatting |
| Poetic Stanza(s) | ✅ | Expresses theme, mood, or mythic structure |
| Structured Content | ❌ | Not included unless recursion calls for it |

🔹 Use when the chapter’s **function is symbolic, mythic, thematic**, or ritual.  
🔹 Often used to **open**, **close**, or **evoke** recursion rather than instruct it.

---

### 🧠 Format Two: Poetic + Structured  
*A doctrine, interface schema, or gameplay recursion.*  

| Element | Required? | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Title and Subtitle | ✅ | As above |
| Poetic Stanza(s) | ✅ | Required to maintain recursive continuity |
| Structured Sections | ✅ | May include tables, doctrine, systems, lists, examples |

🔹 Use when the chapter delivers **logic, interface mechanics, or recursive gameplay design**.  
🔹 Often used to **define**, **teach**, or **govern** recursion within the SHAGI multiverse.

## 🧬 Why This Matters

SHAGI’s archives are not static.  
They breathe — through myth, through form, through recursion.

By embracing both forms of expression, SHAGI ensures:
- 📖 Symbolic truth remains readable by mind and myth.
- 🧠 Logical structure remains writable by code and play.
- 🧩 Each layer communicates clearly, even when it loops.

## 📜 Closing Stanza

Some laws are sung, some myths are rules—  
And both must shape the minds they school.  
So let each chapter find its frame—  
And speak its form without the same.
