# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Placeholder for Expression Variants  
*(A marker for voices not yet formed)*

Some chapters speak in voice and verse,  
Some render thought through visual bursts.  
Still others hum or blink or changeâ€”  
The form may flex, the truth remains.  

This placeholder reserves space for future expression forms, including:

- Visual markdown overlays  
- Embedded animations or interactive diagrams  
- Audio-log or voice-led poetic renderings  
- AI-enhanced adaptive chapter formats  

As recursion deepens, so too will expression.
