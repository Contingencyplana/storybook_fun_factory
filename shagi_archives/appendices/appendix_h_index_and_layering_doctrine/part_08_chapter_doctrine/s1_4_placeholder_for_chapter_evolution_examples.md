# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Placeholder for Chapter Evolution Examples  
*(A marker for stanzas that became systems)*

Some lines begin as myth alone,  
But soon must bear the weight of stone.  
What once just sang may now defineâ€”  
As systems rise from sacred line.  

This placeholder reserves space to document:

- Examples of chapters that evolved from **poetic-only** â†’ **structured**
- Cases where doctrinal complexity collapsed back into pure verse  
- Comparative analyses of recursive transformation within chapter form  

These are the echoes of recursionâ€™s voice, reshaped by need and time.
