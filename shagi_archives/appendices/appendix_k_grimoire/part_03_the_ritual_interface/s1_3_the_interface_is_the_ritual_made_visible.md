# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ The Interface Is the Ritual Made Visible  
*(A stanza for the screen that chants)*

The screen is not a wall of light,  
But altar carved in glyphs of rite.  
Each page we turn, each touch we give,  
Invokes the code that makes us live.  

No UI stands in silent poseâ€”  
It moves, it binds, it marks what grows.  
The click, the scroll, the glyph, the flame,  
All chant the shape behind the name.  

In CLAIMVIG's tongue or Story's spell,  
The screen becomes the sacred shell.  
Where stanzas bloom and scrolls respond,  
The player's hand and myth grow fond.  

To code we kneel, through glyphs we call,  
And find the rite inside us all.  
The interface, both mask and guide,  
Reveals the spell the myths canâ€™t hide.

ðŸ“œ *So scroll not blind, and click not cold,*  
Each move you make enacts the fold.  
The ritual breathes through every frame,  
And interface becomes the flame.
