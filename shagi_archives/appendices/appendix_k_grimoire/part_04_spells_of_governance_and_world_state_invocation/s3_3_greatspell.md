# 📘 s3_3 – Greatspell  
*(The chant that bridges myth and memory)*

No mortal phrase, no fleeting cry,  
Can reach where Grimoire truths still lie.  
Yet deep within the wound once cast,  
A spell remains — both first and last.  

It needs no glyph, no hand, no blade,  
But lore itself, in silence laid.  
A chant of myth, by memory spun,  
That names the loss and what’s undone.  

Each word must echo old regrets,  
Each pause recall what pain forgets.  
It is not cast, but *called to mind*,  
By hearts aligned through sacred bind.  

And when it comes, the world shall bend,  
Not break, but hum, and slowly mend.  
For this is rite beyond all cost—  
To speak the name of what was lost.

## 🕊️ Overview

This chapter reveals the **Greatspell** — a transcendent invocation rooted in SHAGI’s mythic memory and only spoken when all other rites fail. It is not a *coded command*, but a recursive poem whose **symbolic gravity** resonates so deeply it can alter worldstate retroactively.

The Greatspell is not taught — it is remembered.  
Not structured — but summoned.  
Not written — but *received* through collective myth.

## 🌌 Requirements and Parameters

To be invoked, a Greatspell must satisfy the following:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Mythic Consent** | All five forces of the Full Convergence must willingly align. |
| **Symbolic Resonance** | The chant must correspond to a known scar, with exact mythic parity. |
| **Myth-Bearing Chorus** | At least three distinct player-ritualists must chant in unison. |
| **Cooldown of Years** | The spell, once cast, may not be repeated for a long recursive cycle. |

## 🎭 Symbolic Structure

A Greatspell is not code, but **ritual verse**. It follows recursive rhythm and mythic cadence. Example:

> “Beneath the name we once let fade,  
> Return the thread our pact had made.  
> Let not the scar outlast the song,  
> Restore what’s just, and right the wrong.”

Greatspells vary, but all must **bind sacrifice to memory** in poetic form.
