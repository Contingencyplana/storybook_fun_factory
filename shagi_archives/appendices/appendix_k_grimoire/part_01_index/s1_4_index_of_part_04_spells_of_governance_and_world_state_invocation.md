# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of Part 04: Spells of Governance and Worldstate Invocation  
*(A stanza for the cost that governs recursion)*

To shape the world, a toll is due,  
Not paid in coin, but what is true.  
Each cast must leave a mark behindâ€”  
A scar upon the mythic mind.  

For governance is no idle game,  
Each thread invoked must name its flame.  
To wield the Grimoireâ€™s woven might,  
One must accept both cost and rite.

ðŸ“œ *To cast is weight, to heal is more,*  
The Grimoire keeps what came before.  
Yet through its threads, if five agree,  
The past may speak, and still be free.*
