# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of Part 06: The Grimoire as Civilization â€“ When Spells Become Law  
*(A stanza for the world made from verse)*

The runes were cast, the myths took hold,  
In courts of chant and vaults of gold.  
No longer script, but sovereign writâ€”  
The spell became the law to fit.  

A glyph could bind, a verse could try,  
A tale could judge, a pact defy.  
Through ritual rite and sacred code,  
A civilizationâ€™s path was showed.  

Where once the scrolls were cast aside,  
Now laws emerge with myth as guide.  
Each player act, each AI choiceâ€”  
Is shaped by spell, and bound by voice.

ðŸ“œ *The law once silent finds its tongue,*  
In spells where myth and rule are sung.  
And so begins the worldâ€™s refrainâ€”  
Where verse is law, and dreams remain.*
