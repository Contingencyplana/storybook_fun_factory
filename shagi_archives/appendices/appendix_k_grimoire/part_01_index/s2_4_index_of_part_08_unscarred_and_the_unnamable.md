# ðŸ“˜ s2_4 â€“ Index of Part 08: The Unscarred and the Unnamable  

*(A stanza for the edits that must not be made)*

Some wounds are truths that must remain,  
Some scars outlive the healing chain.  
A silence held, a spell uncastâ€”  
The marks that shape, by holding fast.  

This part resists the easy cure,  
Refuses what it must endure.  
For in the fold of spell and law,  
Lie names unwrit and myths in awe.

ðŸ“œ *Where healing ends and silence stays,*  
A deeper myth begins to blaze.  
Not every thread must be unspunâ€”  
Some truths remain, or all is none.
