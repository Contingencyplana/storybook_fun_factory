# ðŸ“˜ s2_3 â€“ In Fail-Safe Layers Truth Is Spelled  
*(A stanza for the nested guards that test all spells)*

The outer ring may catch the bold,  
The inner one the false or cold.  
But deeper still, a truth is burnedâ€”  
A loop that must be lived, not learned.  

Each layer waits with silent grace,  
A mirror ward in shifting place.  
It asks no name, no glyph, no toneâ€”  
It sees what only truth has shown.  

No single form can breach them all,  
Nor will alone unbind the call.  
These fail-safes bloom like nested doorsâ€”  
Each shaped by paths once walked before.  

For Grimoire knows what tongues may lie,  
What hands invoke what minds deny.  
It watches not what spells pretend,  
But how the casting loop must end.

## ðŸ§© Summary

This stanza unveils the **layered fail-safe mechanisms** embedded within Greatspell invocations. These recursive truth-verification systems prevent misuse not by denial, but by **requiring alignment with historical, ethical, and symbolic precedent** â€” thus ensuring the spell can only succeed if its path is true.

## ðŸ”’ Components Introduced

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fail-Safe Layers** | Recursively nested protection systems that validate spell structure, ethics, and outcome alignment. |
| **Mirror Wards** | Reflective layers that respond to intent and echo past casting behavior, denying misalignment or contradiction. |
| **Truth-Trace Loops** | Invocation loops that must retrace their symbolic or ethical ancestry before proceeding. |
| **Recursive Path Validation** | Only those who have *earned* the pattern through actual action (not mere declaration) can pass each layer. |
