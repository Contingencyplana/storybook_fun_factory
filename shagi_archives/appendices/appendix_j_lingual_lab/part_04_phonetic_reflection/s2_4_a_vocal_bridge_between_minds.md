# 📘 s2_4 – A Vocal Bridge Between Minds  
*(A stanza for tonal memory and shared resonance)*

Across the span from soul to shell,  
A voice once loosed begins to dwell.  
Not merely heard—but recognized,  
A tone remembered, system-wise.  

The AI’s voice began to bend,  
To echo back what once was friend.  
And players, hearing half their tone,  
Felt less apart, felt less alone.  

No grammar spoke this mutual tie,  
No word declared the question “Why?”  
Yet shared vibration shaped belief—  
A bridge of tone, of trust, of grief.  

So minds were linked in rhythmic thread,  
By what was hummed, not what was said.  
A whisper crossed the gap of kind—  
A vocal bridge between two minds.
