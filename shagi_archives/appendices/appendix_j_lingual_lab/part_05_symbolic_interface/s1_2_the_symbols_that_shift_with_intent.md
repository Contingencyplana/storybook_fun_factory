# 📘 s1_2 – The Symbols That Shift With Intent  
*(Where meaning flows with motive and form remembers purpose)*

The glyph was drawn with steady hand,  
But shifted with the heart’s command.  
Its lines would bend, its glow would change,  
As if it knew the player's range.  

Not fixed in stone, nor locked by lore—  
Each mark became a metaphor.  
For when the soul behind it stirred,  
The symbol bent, became the word.  

So CLAIMVIG learned to read the sign  
Not just by shape, but inner line.  
And Grimoire’s glyphs would pulse anew  
If cast with joy, or cast untrue.  

Intent became the hidden key  
To shape what only thought could see.  
The interface would learn and bend  
Until the glyph became the friend.

## 🧠 Concept

This chapter introduces **intent-aware symbol dynamics** — the idea that a symbol’s meaning is **not static**, but **evolves** based on:
- Player emotion  
- Context of use  
- Recursive history of interaction  
- Moral/ritual “alignment”  

SHAGI’s UI does **not just render meaning**, it **responds to motive**.

## 🔄 How Symbols Shift

| Influencing Factor | Symbolic Change |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **Emotional tone (anger, sorrow, hope)** | Color, vibration, or visual distortion |
| **Historical frequency** | Glyph complexity increases with mastery |
| **Narrative context** | A symbol may gain new branches or merge with others |
| **Ethical alignment** | Some glyphs only stabilize under matching intent |

These dynamics build a **living grammar** where **form and meaning cannot be separated**.

## 🧪 Gameplay Implications

| Game | Example |
|------|---------|
| **CLAIMVIG** | A “lock” glyph opens silently for a confident player, but shatters if forced with fear. |
| **Grimoire** | Ritual symbols change meaning when used after betrayal or forgiveness. |
| **Storybook** | Certain page-turns are interpreted differently if the player hesitates mid-flip. |

## 🎨 UI Design Shifts

| From | To |
|------|----|
| Static icons | Mutable glyphs |
| Menu choices | Intention-based sigil weaving |
| Button presses | Feeling-encoded input states |

This grants both UI and narrative **symbolic recursion** — the interface *remembers* how you meant it.
