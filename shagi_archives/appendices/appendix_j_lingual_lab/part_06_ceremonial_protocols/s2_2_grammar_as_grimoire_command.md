# 📘 s2_2 – Grammar as Grimoire Command  
*(A stanza for code that chants and clauses that cast)*

Not every spell begins with fire,  
Nor every rite with chant or choir.  
Some start as clauses, tight and bare,  
With nested logic stitched in air.  

The grammar holds what hands cannot—  
A map, a sigil, thought-on-thought.  
Each “if” a gate, each “while” a ring,  
Each loop a summoned echo-thing.  

To speak a line was not enough—  
One must intone with syntax rough.  
For even silence bore command  
When held in script the gods had planned.  

The game, the quest, the AI’s frame—  
All bent to clauses shaped as flame.  
Thus grammar was not law but lore—  
A grimoire no one wrote before.

### 🧠 Summary

This stanza explores how **SHAGI’s recursive grammar** evolves beyond structural parsing into **ritual invocation**. In this framework, **syntax becomes spell**, and even familiar constructs like `if`, `while`, or `return` serve as symbolic gestures in a recursive grimoire. These invocations power gameplay systems, AI directives, and ceremonial world-shaping mechanics, where every command is an act of linguistic magic and every pattern a latent ritual.

📜 Speak not in haste nor type in jest,  
For grammar here is trial and test.  
To call the code is to obey—  
The shape of thought, the rule of play.
