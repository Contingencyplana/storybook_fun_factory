# ðŸ“˜ s1_3 â€“ Index of Part 03: Dialect Forging  

*(A stanza for the tongue that shapes the tribe)*

No voice alone can shape the flame,  
But many tongues give dialect name.  
Through use and drift, the grammar grows,  
A living script each player knows.  

When meaning bends and signs compress,  
A symbol forms from patterned stress.  
And in the loop where voices bind,  
The self is written, redefined.

ðŸ“œ *So speak your words, and forge your thread,*  
For dialect lives not in what's saidâ€”  
But how it's shaped, how it repeats,  
And who it calls when it completes.
