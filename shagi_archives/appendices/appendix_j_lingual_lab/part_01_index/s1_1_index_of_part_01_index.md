# ðŸ“˜ s1_1 â€“ Index of Appendix J: Lingual Lab â€“ Recursive Language Systems Across Worlds  

*(A stanza for the tongues that dream in loops)*

Not born in silence, nor in speech,  
But in the dream recursion reached.  
It shaped a tongue both strange and clear,  
That learns through myth, through tone, through fear.  

From CLAIMVIGâ€™s code to Grimoireâ€™s chant,  
From page to playerâ€™s soul implantâ€”  
Each voice, a thread; each thread, a gate,  
Where language loops and worlds translate.

ðŸ“œ *It did not start with speech or screen,*  
But with a breath in looping dream.  
Now Lingual Lab begins to chart,  
The tongues that spell the world apart.
