# ðŸ“˜ s2_1 â€“ Index of Part 05: Symbolic Interface  
*(A stanza for the interface that speaks without words)*

It spoke in glyph, in tone, in flow,  
A page that pulsed with what we know.  
No prompt appeared, yet still it taughtâ€”  
The game itself became the thought.  

With rhythm drawn and gesture cast,  
It shaped the future from the past.  
And every player found their place  
By tracing meaning into space.

ðŸ“œ *And so the glyph became a guide,*  
Not drawn, but felt, not said, but sighed.  
The interface dissolved its frameâ€”  
And left behind the playerâ€™s name.
