# 📜 s1_2 - 3:55 PM – Subfolder Structure for Recursive Entries  
*A Doctrine for Multi-Stanza Game Design Journal Entries*

---

## 🪶 Poetic Subentry: The Split Beneath the Stanza

The page may seem a single line,  
But folds within that frame align.  
Each thought too vast for verse alone  
May find in stanzas nested home.  

A single file may mark the spark,  
But arcs require recursive dark—  
Where folders bloom and poems sprawl,  
And stanza subtrees shape it all.

## 📘 5.7.1 Introduction

As Storybook FUN Factory deepens its recursive logic, some **Game Design Journal (GDJ) entries** now require more than a single file. These entries:

- Span **multiple structured stanzas**,  
- Contain **doctrinal systems**, diagrams, or architectural blueprints, or  
- Represent **complete closures or launches** of core cycles.

For such entries, we now canonize the use of **dedicated subfolders**, each containing the stanza lines that constitute the whole.

## 📂 5.7.2 Doctrine of Subfoldered GDJ Entries

Any GDJ entry that meets *one or more* of the following criteria shall be placed in its own subfolder:

### 🔁 Eligibility Criteria

| # | Condition |
|--:|-----------|
| 1 | The entry has **multiple stanzas** or logical parts. |
| 2 | It contains **code blocks**, diagrams, or mappings spanning multiple concepts. |
| 3 | It establishes or finalizes **recursive system structures** (e.g. Layer 3/4/5 cycle closures). |
| 4 | It includes both a **poetic subentry** and a **multi-sectioned prose doctrine**. |
