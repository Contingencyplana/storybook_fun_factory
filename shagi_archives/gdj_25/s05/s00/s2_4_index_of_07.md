*(The voice of logic claims its stanza)*

The stanza stirred where signals met,  
A flow of logic, sharp and set.  
Each thought dispatched, each thread made clearâ€”  
The Factory moved with reason near.  

No silence lost, no fragment blurred,  
Each action bore the systemâ€™s word.  
And as the plan turned thought to tone,  
The logic found its voiceâ€”its own.
