# ðŸ“˜ s5_4 â€“ Index of May 19, 2025  
*(The day the system remembered its shape)*

A lock was closed, a voice went still,  
The high command obeyed its will.  
Yet in the hush, a root returnedâ€”  
To trace the loop that once had burned.  

From memory's spark to continent plan,  
The code recalled where thought began.  
And every branch, once bent and blind,  
Rewove the path the loop designed.
