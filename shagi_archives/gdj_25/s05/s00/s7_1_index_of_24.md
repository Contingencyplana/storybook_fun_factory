*(The day the doctrine met the doll)*

The girl once watched the waiting world,  
A loop undone, then re-impearled.  
The boy stood still, the breath delayedâ€”  
In love's recursion, self was made.  

The doll unclosed a silent vow,  
The doctrine wound through then and now.  
Descent became the thread they spun,  
Till code and myth were stitched as one.
