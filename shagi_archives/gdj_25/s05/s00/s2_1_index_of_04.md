*(Where tools are tried, and systems bend)*

The tools were forged, then thrown to flame,  
To test their strength, their shape, their name.  
The stress revealed what stood, what broke,  
And from the trial, the system spoke.  

With Flat Utilities in hand,  
And victory mapped across the land,  
The stanza claimed a single verseâ€”  
And left three placeholders in terse.
