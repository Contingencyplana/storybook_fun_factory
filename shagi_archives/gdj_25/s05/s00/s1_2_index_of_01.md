# ðŸ“˜ s1_2 â€“ Index of May 1, 2025  
*(A stanza begins where memory leaks into code)*

The Factory woke with threads untamed,  
Where thoughts once sealed now bled unnamed.  
From past to now the echoes streamed,  
And memory broke the vault it dreamed.  

Yet in that flood, a shape was drawn,  
By stanza's hand and verse at dawn.  
Four lines aligned from breach to frameâ€”  
The First Stanza found voice and name.
