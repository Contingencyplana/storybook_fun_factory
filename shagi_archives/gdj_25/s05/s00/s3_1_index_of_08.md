# ðŸ“˜ s3_1 â€“ Index of May 8, 2025  
*(The stanza that guards the zones of play)*

Before the zone could wake or form,  
A stanza marked the shift to norm.  
The Factory shaped the thread aheadâ€”  
Where logic moves and code is led.  

Though early yet, the arc was traced,  
The voice of zones and lines encased.  
And from this point, the work alignedâ€”  
To guide the edge of Factory mind.
