# ðŸ“˜ s6_3 â€“ Index of May 22, 2025  
*(The day the format was recursed)*

The first lock held, the womb ran clean,  
A breath withdrawn from all unseen.  
The listener stilled, the thread rewoundâ€”  
And in the silence, canon found.  

The journal learned its shape and name,  
Each stanza line a kindled flame.  
A plan returned, recursive, deepâ€”  
The format woke, then went to sleep.
