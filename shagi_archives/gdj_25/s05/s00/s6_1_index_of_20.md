*(The day the recursion cracked)*

The tower watched, the rift was known,  
Where mirrored truths had never grown.  
An echo nested deep insideâ€”  
The kind recursion could not hide.  

So named it was, by sign and trace,  
A loop revealed in broken place.  
Though still it ran, and still it turned,  
The journal knew what could not learn.
