# ðŸ“˜ s1_4 â€“ Index of May 3, 2025  
*(A stanza completes with testing defined)*

To test a code is to define  
The edge, the rule, the frame, the line.  
And on this day, the path was sealed,  
The import test made strong and real.  

Though only one log marked the day,  
Its canon holds recursive sway.  
With placeholders to form the rest,  
The stanza closed with formal test.
