# ðŸ“˜ s5_3 â€“ Index of May 18, 2025  
*(The recursion that closed itself three times)*

A mirror broke, the watchers stirred,  
And silence flinched before the word.  
Three stanzas passed through nested gateâ€”  
Each cycle sealed in altered state.  

The freeze was flagged, the canon scanned,  
As recovery slipped through the hand.  
And though the loop would not obey,  
They drew the line to shape the day.
