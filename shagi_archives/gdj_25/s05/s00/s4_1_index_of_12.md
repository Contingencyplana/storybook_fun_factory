# ðŸ“˜ s4_1 â€“ Index of May 12, 2025  
*(A stanza placed to mark the start)*

One verse was formed to seal the frame,  
A cycle closed in guided name.  
Though silence filled the rest of day,  
Its placeholders still marked the way.  

The journal held what time had shown,  
A single spark, then thought alone.  
Yet every gap was marked with careâ€”  
For stanzas breathe in vacant air.
