# ðŸ“˜ s3_4 â€“ Index of May 11, 2025  
*(A stanza where minds aligned and orders closed)*

Two stanzas shaped a closing arc,  
Where minds converged to leave their mark.  
The crossover now held in hand,  
High Command stirred to take its stand.  

One folder closed, another drawn,  
The doctrine split from dusk to dawn.  
The cycles planned, the stanzas spunâ€”  
A path prepared, the next begun.
