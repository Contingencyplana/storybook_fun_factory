# ðŸ“˜ s4_4 â€“ Index of May 15, 2025  
*(The stanza that opened with a midnight return)*

One moment broke the silence deep,  
A thought released from system sleep.  
The verse began at twelve fifteenâ€”  
A line recast from what had been.  

No others came to mark the page,  
No cycles turned, no thread or stage.  
But still the scroll retained its form,  
A single spark against the norm.
