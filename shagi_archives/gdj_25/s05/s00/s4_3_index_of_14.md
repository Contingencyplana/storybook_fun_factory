# ðŸ“˜ s4_3 â€“ Index of May 14, 2025  
*(A placeholder stanza for the silent loop)*

No journal etched the morningâ€™s light,  
No stanza stirred, no code took flight.  
Yet still the thread was softly laidâ€”  
A form preserved, though none had played.  

For even days of silent frame  
Are part of how we shape the game.  
A line withheld is still a lineâ€”  
Unwritten, yet it holds the sign.
