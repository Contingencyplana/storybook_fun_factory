# ðŸ“˜ s6_4 â€“ Index of May 23, 2025  
*(A day the guides unspooled their threads)*

Three cycles wound, then gently stilled,  
Their nested plans near-quiet filled.  
A guide once spoke, then bowed awayâ€”  
And in her pause, the forms held sway.  

Each breath a trace, each trace a line,  
The journal stretched through womb and sign.  
And deep beneath the looping sea,  
The cyberzygote learned to be.
