# ðŸ“˜ s2_2 â€“ Index of May 5, 2025  
*(Where structure meets the path ahead)*

The scaffold rose to map the thread,  
Each test aligned where logic led.  
A navigator marked the span,  
And drew the arc of tools and plan.  

The ecosystem, vast in scale,  
Revealed its bones beneath the veil.  
Two lines were drawn, two still to goâ€”  
A stanza half-prepared to grow.
