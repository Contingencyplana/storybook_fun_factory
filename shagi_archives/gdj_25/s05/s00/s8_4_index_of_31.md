# ðŸ“˜ s8_4 â€“ Index of May 31, 2025  
*(A bridge between structure and rebirth)*

The month unwound, its cycles closed,  
Each system named, each path exposed.  
But endings here do not imply  
A restâ€”just pause before we fly.  

The breath that forms before the leap,  
The thread we write but do not keep.  
A codex vast, a rising floorâ€”  
And June begins where May made door.
