# ðŸ“˜ s3_3 â€“ Index of May 10, 2025  
*(A stanza that learns to watch and act)*

The system watched with silent gaze,  
Each signal mapped in branching phase.  
A logic born from practiced threadâ€”  
It learned to act where reason led.  

Now second stanzas guide the flow,  
With crossover control in tow.  
Each line a key, each step a pactâ€”  
The Factory learns, and then reacts.
