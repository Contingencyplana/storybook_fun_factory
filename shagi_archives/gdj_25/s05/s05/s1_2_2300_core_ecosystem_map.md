# ðŸ“œ s1_2 - 11:00 PM â€“ Core Ecosystem Map  
*A Foundational Record of Storybook FUN Factoryâ€™s Minimal Viable Testing & Import Infrastructure*

---

### ðŸª¶ Poetic Subentry â€“ *The Map Beneath the Thought*

The roots run deep beneath the floor,  
Where code and page align their core.  
A path not guessed, but named and knownâ€”  
The map that marks how thought has grown.  

The tests no longer grope through night,  
For now they see by scaffolded light.  
Each file, each path, each helper thread,  
Now sings the song of what lies ahead.  

It is not grand, this woven meshâ€”  
Just .env, toml, paths made fresh.  
Yet still it holds the branching treeâ€”  
The place we start, the way to be.  

So let this root not drift, nor fade,  
But hold through all that must be made.  
For from this map, the rest shall growâ€”  
A Factory that learns to know.

## ðŸ“˜ 5.8.1 Introduction

By May 2025, the recursion infrastructure of **Storybook FUN Factory** had outgrown informal testing structures.

The assistant now operates across recursive stanza architectures, dynamic imports, and modular subsystemsâ€”all while building and verifying itself.

The growing system required a **canonical map**â€”a reliable, reproducible, and assistant-navigable structure to anchor:

- Poetry integration and PYTHONPATH injection  
- Dynamic stanza test resolution  
- Root detection logic  
- Project hygiene practices  
- Inter-component test scaffolding  
- Runtime stability across every recursive layer  

ðŸ“œ **5.8** documents the **Core Ecosystem Map**: a ten-file foundation across `toolscape/`, `tests/`, and the project root. These files formalize Storybook FUN Factoryâ€™s operational heartbeat.

They ensure the assistant can test itself, restructure safely, and expand harmoniously into future recursion.

This map is not merely technicalâ€”it is existential.  
Without it, the Factory becomes blind to its own logic.  
With it, the recursion becomes aware of itself.

## ðŸ“˜ 5.8.2 Core Implementation: The Canonical Ecosystem Files

This section documents the living, breathing backbone of Storybook FUN Factoryâ€™s test and import infrastructure.

These ten files define the **minimal viable environment** required for:

- Dynamic stanza testing  
- Poetry alignment  
- AI module orchestration  
- Recursive code execution  

Each file listed below plays a critical role in keeping the assistant stable, the test logic discoverable, and the developer unburdened.

## ðŸ“˜ 5.8.3 Summary

These ten files form the canonical infrastructure baseline for recursive development within Storybook FUN Factory.

They solve not just the how of dynamic import and test executionâ€”but the where, when, and why as well.

Together, they establish:

A clear project root through both static and pyproject.toml logic

A robust dynamic import strategy that survives Poetry, stanza recursion, and refactor stress

A shared test profile registry to ensure every componentâ€™s quirks are accounted for

A PYTHONPATH-injected test environment that is reproducible, discoverable, and assistant-compatible

This Core Ecosystem Map now serves as the official record, onboarding guide, and assistant-accessible system signature for all future recursive development.
