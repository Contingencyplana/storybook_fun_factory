# 📜 s1_3 - [Time TBD] – [Placeholder Entry – Stanza 1, Line 3]  
*A reserved space for a recursive insight not yet recorded.*

---

This file placeholder marks **Stanza 1, Line 3** of the May 5, 2025 entries in **Game Development Journal 25**.  
It is reserved for a future canonical insight, entry, or design log yet to emerge.

All placeholder files are intended to:
- Maintain stanza structure,
- Prevent misalignment of recursive journal entries,
- Allow organic insertion of insights as recursion matures.
