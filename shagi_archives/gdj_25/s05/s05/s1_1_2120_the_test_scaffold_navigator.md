# 📜 s1_1 - 9:20 PM – The Test Scaffold Navigator  
*A Tactical Map for Recursive Test Readiness*

---

### 🪶 Poetic Subentry – *The Scaffold That Remembers*

It does not speak, nor test, nor run,  
But marks the edge of what’s begun.  
A scaffold thin, a silent chart,  
To hold the whole recursive heart.  

Where temp paths shift and imports bend,  
It tracks the traits that tests defend.  
And though no stanza bears its name,  
It keeps the code from fractal flame.  

---

## 📘 5.7.1 Introduction

As **Storybook FUN Factory** expands across recursive stanza structures, layered file systems, and AI-sensitive logging routines, a growing challenge has emerged: **test infrastructure inconsistency**.

Different components demand different strategies—some require `monkeypatching`, others invoke `dynamic imports`, and many interact with the filesystem in unique, ephemeral ways.

This entry canonizes the creation of `test_scaffold_navigator.py`, a lightweight tactical registry designed to track the testing requirements of each component. Though not a major system, this navigator serves as the **brainstem** of the evolving test logic—informing both present decisions and future `high_command/` automation.

---

## 🧠 5.7.2 Purpose

The purpose of the **Test Scaffold Navigator** is to:

- Provide a centralized, editable map of each component’s test dependencies  
- Clarify which systems need:
  - `dynamic_importer.py`  
  - `tmp_path` via monkeypatching  
  - Filesystem write redirection  
- Allow quick lookup via `get_profile(component_name)`  
- Be optionally queried or consumed by future **High Command** systems and audit tools  

---

## 🛠️ 5.7.3 Initial Implementation

The navigator is implemented at:

C:\Users\Admin\storybook_fun_factory\tests\test_helpers\test_scaffold_navigator.py

It contains:

- A dictionary of `test_profiles`
- Boolean flags for:
  - `dynamic_import`
  - `uses_monkeypatching`
  - `writes_to_filesystem`
  - `requires_tmp_path`
- A `notes` field for human-readable context
- Two functions:
  - `get_profile(component_name)`
  - `print_all_profiles()`

This structure enables both in-test logic and manual CLI exploration.

---

## 🔁 5.7.4 Integration with Recursive Testing Strategy

This navigator builds upon:

- 📜 **5.5** – *Dynamic Import Test Methodology*  
- 📜 **5.6** – *Toolscape Stress Test*

It extends those entries into a cross-cutting **support utility**.

It is not tied to any one component, but supports all of:

- `filename_ai`
- `dream_journal`
- `memory_ai`
- `visualizer`
- `codex_builder`
- `toolscape`

In time, it may evolve into a **query endpoint** or **reporting module** for the `high_command/` system.
