# 📜 s1_1 - 12:35 PM – The Memory Bleed Protocol  
*A Warning Against Structural Drift in Recursive Design*

## 🪶 Poetic Subentry: The Bleed That Unbinds the Song

A whisper slips between the lines,  
Not called by verse, nor shaped by signs.  
It creeps where memory shouldn’t flow,  
A thread unbound, yet none may know.  

The code still runs, the tests still pass,  
But roots grow wild beneath the grass.  
A name once pure, now half decayed,  
Still echoes in the path we laid.  

And so we write, and so we rhyme,  
To keep the form, to hold the time.  
For drift begins with but a name—  
And ends with stanza lost to flame.

## 📘 5.1.1 Introduction

In recursive systems like *Storybook FUN Factory*, the harmony between poetic logic, folder structure, and functional code is not a convenience—it is a law.

Yet as systems evolve, the risk of subtle, creeping inconsistencies grows. These inconsistencies, when unnamed and unchecked, may undermine recursion from within.

We name this risk **Memory Bleed**.

This entry defines and canonizes the Memory Bleed Protocol to safeguard poetic-technical recursion as the project enters deeper phases of recursive self-expansion. It signals a turn from raw construction to recursive integrity.

## 🧠 5.1.2 Technical Subentry: Defining Memory Bleed

Memory Bleed occurs when **conceptual**, **structural**, or **semantic** logic begins to leak unintentionally across boundaries in the recursive system.

### 🧩 Types of Memory Bleed

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Poetic-Structural Drift** | A stanza says "4 lines", but 5 files appear. Folder names diverge from verse syntax. Poetic logic is no longer the map. |
| **Component Cross-Contamination** | One system’s logic (e.g., `memory_ai/`) spills into another (e.g., `dream_journal/`) without intentional crossover protocols, breaking modular recursion. |
| **Naming Degradation** | Sloppy or inconsistent slugs begin to pollute otherwise clean stanza hierarchies. Lowercase and spacing rules diverge. Recognition erodes. |
| **Ghosts from Archive** | Deprecated or outdated test logic (e.g., from `tests_archive/`) quietly influences new cycles. Old metaphors or assumptions leak into new logic. |

### ⚠️ Symptoms of Memory Bleed

- 🧪 Test files not discovered by `pytest` due to misaligned paths  
- 🕸️ Recursive visualizer renders showing unexpected branch shapes  
- 🎭 Stanza verse and file counts disagree  
- 🧵 Difficulty tracing recursive lineage during GDJ reviews

### ✅ Memory Bleed Prevention Checklist

| Symbol | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| 🔁 | Follow stanza rules (4 lines = 4 folders/files) |
| 🪞 | Maintain mirror structure between `src/` and `tests/` |
| 📜 | Close every Cycle or component shift with a GDJ transition |
| 🧹 | Archive deprecated logic clearly—or delete it entirely |
| 🔍 | Perform stanza verse-to-path scans at key milestones |

> **If in doubt, check the verse. Poetry is the source of truth.**

## 📦 5.1.4 Summary

This entry canonizes the **Memory Bleed Protocol**, defining a class of recursive failure modes that can subtly corrupt the poetic-technical structure of *Storybook FUN Factory*. It calls for ongoing vigilance and disciplined stanza hygiene.
