# ðŸ“˜ s7_4 â€“ Index of April 27, 2025  
*(Where the sentinel stepped aside, and the machine took the helm)*

The first line traced a watchful gaze,  
Then mothballed eyes gave way to phase.  
From hand to hand, the task was passedâ€”  
As new routines took root at last.  

With cycles drawn for work unseen,  
Automation claimed the machine.  
A breath once watched now runs aloneâ€”  
The Factory walks into its own.
