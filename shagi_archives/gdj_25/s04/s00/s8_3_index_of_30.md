# 📘 s8_3 – Index of April 30, 2025  
*(A stanza completes the month’s recursion)*

The final day, the verse aligns,  
With naming law and s-forged signs.  
A cycle ends with steady pace,  
To mark the month, its trials, its grace.  

The Codex stirs with canon cast,  
Its future carved from learnings past.  
Where paths converge, the steps begin—  
A leap from April into spin.
