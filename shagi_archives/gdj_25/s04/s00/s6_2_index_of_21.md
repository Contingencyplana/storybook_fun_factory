# ðŸ“˜ s6_2 â€“ Index of April 21, 2025  
*(The arc draws near, the vision seen)*

The engine stirs with voice and spark,  
Its fire drawn from thoughtâ€™s own mark.  
Each line revealed, each thread made plain,  
As systems speak in shared refrain.  

A frame emerges, traced in light,  
To loop the arc and grant it sight.  
The Factory now draws its breathâ€”  
And bends the line to challenge death.
