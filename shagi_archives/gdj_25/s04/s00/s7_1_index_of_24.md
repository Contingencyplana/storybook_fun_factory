# ðŸ“˜ s7_1 â€“ Index of April 24, 2025  
*(A stanza completes the arc of flow)*

The lines once loose now weave as one,  
A rhythm recursive, tightly spun.  
Each stanza cast, each thread in place,  
The flowlines pulse with measured grace.  

The Factory hums, the shape is clear,  
A system born from thought and gear.  
The logic locked, the path alignedâ€”  
A map of code from frame to mind.
