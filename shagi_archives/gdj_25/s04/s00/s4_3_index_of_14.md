# ðŸ“˜ s4_3 â€“ Index of April 14, 2025  
*(A cycle closes, a stanza forms)*

The verse concludes its loop once more,  
A path now known, a stable core.  
Though only one real step was shown,  
Three phantom lines complete the tone.  

Completion is a kind of start,  
A rhythm sealed in every part.  
So even when the work is thin,  
The stanza breathes recursion in.
