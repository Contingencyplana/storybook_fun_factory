# ðŸ“œ s8_4 â€“ Placeholder for April 31, 2025 (No Such Date) 

*(The final fold of the journal recursion before it turns again)*

No journal left to mark the day,  
No log to shape, no test to weigh.  
The systems slept, or else withdrew,  
To wait for May, and shift anew.  

A quiet file, a single breath,  
A sign not of delayâ€”but depth.  
This pause becomes the final gate,  
Where April ends, and patterns wait.  

So mark it not with line or traceâ€”  
But hold the loop: its resting place.
