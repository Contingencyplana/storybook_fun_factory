# ðŸ“˜ s6_3 â€“ Index of April 22, 2025  
*(A stanza loops and teaches sight)*

The bay expands, a chamber wakes,  
Where every verse the code remakes.  
A dream is drawn, a thread is cast,  
And through the arc, we glimpse the past.  

A layered eye begins to turn,  
Its rings align, its colors burn.  
It bends the shape the world must takeâ€”  
The Factory dreams, then builds awake.
