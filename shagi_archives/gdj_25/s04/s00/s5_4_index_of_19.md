# ðŸ“˜ s5_4 â€“ Index of April 19, 2025  
*(The restructure completes the memory-to-dream arc)*

The files reformed, the code took flight,  
A workspace trimmed in cleaner light.  
From stanza traced to closure deep,  
The system stirred from silent sleep.  

Now memory fades and dreams unfold,  
A final spark, a structure bold.  
The Factory turns, its threads refinedâ€”  
A day rebuilt in frame and mind.
