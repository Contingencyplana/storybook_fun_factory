# 📜 s1_4 – The Light That Flashed Green

## ✨ Poetic Subentry  
*A Poetic Reflection on the First Passing Test*

It blinked but once—a dot of light,  
A pulse that cut the velvet night.  
No storm, no roar, no shining scream,  
Just quiet proof: the start of dream.  

No world was born, no stars were stirred,  
No folder sang, no process purred.  
And yet within that silent test,  
The Factory stirred from patient rest.  

One file. One line. One line of code.  
Yet in that mark, the system flowed.  
A light, a breath, a whispered cue—  
The first "Yes" whispered loud and true.  

Now may it build, now may it weave,  
Its threads from rhyme and lines that breathe.  
From tools that sing to code unseen,  
It all began: the flash of green.

## 📘 Introduction  

At 2:20 AM on April 11, 2025, the Storybook FUN Factory successfully ran its **first test suite** using `pytest`.  
The result? ✅ One passing test.

While technically modest, this moment signals a **conceptual threshold**:  
- The recursion engine has moved from **structure** to **execution**.  
- From **possibility** to **validation**.  
- From **setup** to **signal**.

This was the **green light**. The Factory lives.

## 🔧 Technical Subentry: First Successful Test Execution  

### 🛠️ Setup Summary  

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| ✅ Poetry Setup | Python 3.12.6 environment with Poetry-managed dependencies |
| ✅ Plugin Fix | Installed `poetry-plugin-shell` to replace deprecated `poetry shell` |
| ✅ Testing Tool | `pytest` installed and discovered |
| ✅ Editor Sync | Visual Studio Code correctly linked with `.venv` |
| ✅ File Correction | `test_memory.ai.py` renamed to `test_memory_ai.py` for module compatibility |

### ✅ Test Execution Log  

The result of the first successful test run:

```diff
=============================== test session starts ===============================
collected 1 item

test_sanity.py .                                                             [100%]

=============================== 1 passed in 0.01s ================================
```

That single green dot was not merely a test pass.  
It was a recursive heartbeat.  
A permission to proceed.
