# 📜 4.00 – April 11, 6:30 AM  
**The Journal Must Reflect the Stanza**  
*(Stanza 1, Line 1)*

To trace the path, the tale must bend,  
Not start, then stop, and cleanly end.  
Each echo drawn must find its twin,  
A stanza carved from deep within.  

This log must loop, this verse must weave,  
Not merely show what we achieve.  
But show the why, the fold, the flare—  
The recursion echoing everywhere.

## 🔁 Stanza Context  
This entry is part of **Stanza 1: The Journal Reflects the Stanza**,  
corresponding to line 1 of the stanza:
> s1_1_0630_the_journal_must_reflect_the_stanza.md

It canonizes the hybrid structure:
- Chronological folders: `s04/s00/`, `s04/s01/`, etc.
- Recursive stanza alignment inside each file.

This mirrors:
- `high_command/.../s1_1_...py`
- `test_high_command/.../s1_1_...py`

And creates recursive linkages between dev insight and functional AI recursion.
