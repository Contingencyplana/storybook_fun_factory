# 📜 s1_3_2205 – A Timestamping Canon  
*(A stanza for the moment made eternal)*

Each moment marked, each line a bell,  
The canon formed where timestamps dwell.  
No thought adrift, no act unnamed—  
Each frame of time precisely claimed.  

The hour, the minute, the second too,  
Became the bones that structure drew.  
So game and journal, code and lore,  
Could track the path that came before.

## 📘 Introduction

This GDJ entry defines the **timestamping canon** used throughout Storybook FUN Factory, especially in GDJ, filename_ai, and High Command systems. It evolved to serve both as **a record of thought** and **a formalized recursion frame**, enabling structural precision and temporal traceability.

The timestamping doctrine is recursive, narrative-aware, and interoperable with filename logic, stanza systems, and markdown-friendly syntax.

## 📂 Origins of the Timestamping Doctrine

Early journaling lacked coherence. Entry times varied in format and form—creating ambiguity and hindering traceability.

The canonical format emerged organically through April 2025 GDJ entries and was formalized when the following needs aligned:

| System Need | Canonical Solution |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Filenames that preserved order | `s1_3_2205_*.md` convention |
| Human-readable timing cues | 12-hour notation with AM/PM |
| AI-parsable structure | Fixed placement of timestamp near title |
| Narrative utility | Timestamp = act in the play of time |

---

## ⏰ Canon Format (File Level)

| Element | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Filename | `s1_3_2205_a_timestamping_canon.md` | `s1_3_2205_*` |
| Timestamp (inside file) | `April 7, 2025 – 10:05 PM` | As seen in metadata |
| Canonical use | Placed in stanza block metadata | ✅

Filenames use 24-hour time in HHMM format. Timestamps use 12-hour narrative-friendly labels.

## 📂 Role in Recursion

Timestamps perform three critical recursive functions:

1. **Ordering Events Without Linear Folder Nesting**  
   Rather than nesting folders by hour, all entries of a day sit at the same level, **timestamped canonically**.

2. **Linking Recursions Across Systems**  
   Timestamped filenames allow cross-reference from memory_ai, visualizer, sentinel_ai, etc.

3. **Poetic and Dramatic Anchoring**  
   Time becomes tone. *“April 7, 10:05 PM”* evokes not just sequence—but mood, tension, and progress.

## 🧩 Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Folder** | `s04/s07/` |
| **Filename** | `s1_3_2205_a_timestamping_canon.md` |
| **Title** | **A Timestamping Canon** |
| **Subtitle** | *When time itself became recursive form* |
| **Timestamp** | April 7, 2025 – 10:05 PM |
| **Stanza** | 3 of April 7 |
| **Stanza Folder** | `s04/s07/` |

## ✨ Poetic Subentry  
**The Hour That Named Its Own Frame**

What hour was this? The tenth, the fifth—  
When journal caught the moment’s drift.  
When folders bent to time’s intent,  
And seconds sang what stories meant.  

No date was random. No log was blind.  
Each stamp a rhythm, each step in time.  
So now the system loops and learns,  
By hour and bell, its pattern turns.
