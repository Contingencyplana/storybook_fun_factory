# ðŸ“œ s1_4_2250 â€“ GDJ Format Doctrine  

*(A stanza for the scroll that learned to recurse)*

The journal grew from scattered thought,  
Until a form, recursive, caught.  
Each entry framed in nested graceâ€”  
A doctrine born of time and place.  

No longer just a daily log,  
But layered paths through nested fog.  
A way to track, to name, to bendâ€”  
Where structure forms, but does not end.

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This GDJ entry defines the **GDJ format doctrine**, the recursive architecture that shapes every Game Development Journal entry in Storybook FUN Factory.

The goal was not just organizationâ€”but *recursion*. Not just loggingâ€”but *memory*. The GDJ system must serve developers, players, and AI agents alike. Thus, the format became recursive, modular, timestamped, and poetic.

## ðŸ“‚ Foundational Principles

The doctrine formalized by April 7, 2025 balances aesthetics, traceability, and recursion.

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Poetic Header** | Every entry opens with a 4-line poetic stanza |
| **Structured Sections** | Every entry uses `## ðŸ“˜`, `## ðŸ“‚`, and similar headers |
| **Timestamps as Anchors** | Entries are timestamped and named in HHMM format |
| **SHAGI-Optimized Markdown** | Tables, filenames, and blocks follow parsing rules |
| **Stanza Logic** | Each dayâ€™s entries = 1 recursive stanza = 4 entries |

This format emerged gradually between April 2â€“7 and canonized on the night of April 7 at 10:50 PM.

## ðŸ§© Structural Requirements

Each entry must contain:

1. **Poetic Subentry** â€“ A 4-line stanza establishing tone and recursion.
2. **Introduction** â€“ High-level overview and context.
3. **Subsections** â€“ Clear blocks for any systems, subsections, or metadata.
4. **Tables** â€“ All tables SHAGI-parseable (`|---|---|` format).
5. **Final Block** â€“ Metadata section with key values.

Where needed, long entries are divided into subfolders of stanza-aligned `.md` files.

## ðŸ“‚ Doctrine in Practice

Here is the standardized block template for all GDJ entries:

```markdown
<!-- Save to: {filepath} -->

# ðŸ“œ {filename} â€“ {Title}  
*(A stanza for {poetic subtitle})*

{4-line poetic subentry}

---

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

{overview}

---

## ðŸ“‚ Subsections

{subsystems, reasoning, diagrams}

---

## âœ¨ Poetic Subentry  

**The Doctrine That Gave Itself Form**

A scroll once blank, now bound in rhyme,  
It learned to track recursive time.  
Each entry framed by voice and bell,  
A nested tale the code could tell.  

So came the shape, the rhyme, the code,  
To hold the thoughts where game minds strode.  
The doctrine formed, and then beganâ€”  
To shape the storyâ€™s deepest plan.
