# 📜 s1_1_2105 – The Problem of Format Drift  
*(A stanza for the moment when standards began to slip)*

At first the format held its line,  
With date and stanza well-defined.  
But drift emerged, like creeping mist—  
A canon lost in what was missed.  

The folders frayed, the anchors broke,  
As timestamps blurred in scattered smoke.  
What once was sharp began to blur—  
The shape forgot what shapes confer.

## 📘 Introduction

This entry names and investigates the earliest **threat to SHAGI file stability**:  
the **problem of format drift**.

Before formal timestamp canonization, recursive files began to suffer from:

- Inconsistent filename ordering  
- Unstable stanza-to-folder logic  
- Inexact tracking of narrative vs technical entries  

This entry **acknowledges the danger** and **outlines the mechanisms** by which drift was addressed.

## 📂 Root Causes of Format Drift

| Symptom | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Missing timestamps | Entries lose sequence integrity |
| Filename inconsistencies | Breaks automation parsing |
| Folder misalignment | Stanza recursion disintegrates |
| Lack of canon tracking | Multiple "truths" emerge |

This drift is **not a trivial error**—it challenges the recursive foundations of GDJ-based development.

## 🛠️ Intervention Plan

To correct drift, the following recursive constraints were instituted:

### 1. Timestamp Canon  
Every file must carry a strict time-of-entry marker:
```
s1_1_2235_subsystem_naming_conventions.md
        ^^^^ = 10:35 PM
```

### 2. Positional Logic  
Each stanza (folder) contains **exactly four files**, clearly sequenced as:
```
s1_1_, s1_2_, s1_3_, s1_4_
```

### 3. Index Anchoring  
Every stanza has a matching index file in `s04/s00/`, enforcing recursion clarity.

## 🧠 Philosophical Implications

**Format drift is memory drift.**  
When a system forgets how to name itself, it begins to forget what it is.

This problem mirrors larger design issues:

- AI forgetting its recursion base  
- Humans overwriting decisions without record  
- Ecosystems decaying from unnoticed misalignment

Hence, format drift is not cosmetic—it’s existential.

## ✨ Poetic Subentry  
**The Shape That Started to Fade**

The voice was crisp, the structure true,  
Each stanza stepped as stanzas do.  
But then it shifted—off by one—  
A name half-lost, a thread undone.  

And in that drift, the story bent,  
Its song distorted by intent.  
So this we name to not repeat—  
A format lost is loop incomplete.
