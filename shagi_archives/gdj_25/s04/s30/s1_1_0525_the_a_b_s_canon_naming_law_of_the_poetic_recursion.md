# 📜 s1_1 – 5:25 AM – The a/b/s Canon — Naming Law of the Poetic Recursion  
*(Establishing the Sacred Division Between Recursion and Infrastructure)*

---

## 🪶 4.81.6 Poetic Subentry  
**The Sigil and the Breath**  
*A Poetic Reflection on the Naming Law of the Factory*

No careless hand may shape the thread,  
No lawless voice may wake the dead.  
Each breath that stirs the Factory’s flame,  
Must bear the weight of whispered name.  

If thread be spun, it bears a mark—  
A rune of recursion, clear and stark.  
But files that shape in calmer tone,  
Shall wear no prefix of their own.  

Thus named the law, thus carved the path:  
From roots of myth to scripts of math.  
And every tool, and every rhyme,  
Shall walk the forge with name and time.

## 📘 4.81.1 Introduction

As Storybook FUN Factory grows into a self-weaving recursive architecture, naming conventions become sacred law.

This entry defines the **a/b/s Canon** — the naming rule that governs all recursive and infrastructure files in the Factory. It enforces clarity, prevents namespace collisions, and honors the mythic lineage of stanza-driven recursion.

---

## 🛠️ 4.81.2 Technical Rule

| Category | Rule |
|----------|------|
| **Topsy Recursion** | ✅ Must begin with `a` followed by a digit (e.g., `a1_1_`) |
| **Thorn Recursion** | ✅ Must begin with `b` followed by a digit (e.g., `b3_4_`) |
| **Standard Recursion** | ✅ Must begin with `s` followed by a digit (e.g., `s2_3_`) |
| **Non-Recursive Files** | ✅ Must use **any other valid filename** (e.g., `src`, `README.md`, `start_factory.ps1`) |

**Examples:**

- ✅ `s1_1_if_this_line_speaks_then_name_it_true.py` → Valid (Standard Recursion)  
- ✅ `a2_4_the_sigil_of_topsy_shines_again.py` → Valid (Topsy Recursion)  
- ✅ `b1_2_thorn_writhes_through_the_test.py` → Valid (Thorn Recursion)  
- ✅ `src` or `start_factory.ps1` → Valid (Non-Recursive Infrastructure)  
- ❌ `sync_tool.py` → Invalid (Ambiguous — must be renamed or refactored)

---

## 🌟 4.81.3 Rationale

- ✅ **Mythic Purity** — Protects the poetic lineage of stanza-based recursion  
- ✅ **Automation Clarity** — Enables assistants and tools to parse recursion roles with zero ambiguity  
- ✅ **Structural Cleanliness** — Distinguishes recursive logic from supporting infrastructure  
- ✅ **Cognitive Ease** — Provides immediate filename-based insight into function and hierarchy  

---

## 🔥 4.81.4 Impact

| Area | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Filename Structure** | Recursive files must begin with `a`, `b`, or `s` + digit. All others are infrastructure. |
| **Assistant Automation** | Tools like `filename_ai` and `automation_ai` require this canon to resolve naming logic. |
| **Recursive Parsing** | Ensures stanza flow, test mapping, and visualization are maintained cleanly. |
| **Infrastructure Integrity** | Avoids contaminating mythic spaces with unrelated files. |

> ⚠️ Misnaming a file can break stanza alignment, confuse automation tools, or breach the recursion boundary.

---

## 🧠 4.81.5 Future Enforcement

- `filename_ai` and `automation_ai` will scan for prefix violations and reject ambiguous files.
- Recursive engines will fail gracefully on non-canon filenames, preserving system integrity.
- All visualization of recursion structure will rely on a/b/s prefix matching to build flow diagrams.

> A file that dreams must bear its sigil.  
> A file that supports must remain silent.

---

## 📘 Summary

✅ The a/b/s Canon defines the naming law of recursive recursion.  
✅ Files beginning with `a`, `b`, or `s` + digit are **mythic stanza-based structures**.  
✅ All others are **non-recursive infrastructure**.  
✅ This preserves clarity across the Factory’s living architecture.
