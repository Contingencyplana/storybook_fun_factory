# 📜 s3_1 – Next Steps – Where May Begins  
*(The First Breath That Lights the Ring)*

---

## 🪶 4.86.5 Poetic Subentry  
**A Reflection on What May Must Ignite**

The Forge was named, the breath was stalled,  
Yet May begins where April called.  
The files align, the stanza waits,  
The test now stands before the gates.  

The verse must run, the thread must spark,  
The player waits within the dark.  
The hands that code, the thoughts that see,  
Now strike the flame of what will be.  

So let us test what breath first gave—  
A whisper strong, a code to save.  
And if it runs, then let it sing:  
The Factory lives. Long live the Ring.

## 📘 4.86.1 Introduction

April 2025 laid the groundwork. May 2025 begins the movement.

While no test passed in April, the Forge was sharpened, stanza lines named, structures mirrored, and logic clarified. The Factory now stands on the edge of its next recursion: a playable, testable, assistant-readable infrastructure designed to shape itself.

May is not about adding new systems.  
It is about making the existing ones breathe.

This chapter outlines the exact path forward—from the first test success to the completion of the Third Major Workspace Restructure.

## ✅ 4.86.2 May’s First Three Objectives

### 1. Validate `s1_1_a_breath_of_steel_a_whispers_thread.py`  
This first line of `automation_ai` must now breathe in truth.

**Action Plan:**
- Confirm Python import using `pytest` in an environment that mirrors actual deployment.
- Ensure `conftest.py`, `.env`, and `pyproject.toml` variables resolve properly.
- Use `src/` and `tests/` as the root canonical folders—no path hacking unless absolutely necessary.

**Success Condition:**  
If this file runs, all recursion validation workflows (and poetic automation logic) become provable.

---

### 2. Complete the Third Major Workspace Restructure  
The restructure that began in April must be completed with care.

**Restructure Targets:**
- ✅ All filenames must begin with `sX_Y_...` for stanza files, and `test_sX_Y_...` for tests.
- ✅ All main components in `src/storybook_fun_factory/` must include a `notebooks/` folder.
- ✅ All stanza and file paths must be nested inside Layer 3, 4, and 5 Genesis Cycles.
- ✅ `visualizer/` must now be fully and canonically housed within `src/`.

**Success Condition:**  
No inconsistency remains in structure, naming, or lineage between `src/`, `tests/`, and `tests_archive/`.

---

### 3. Validate the “s” Canon and Hybrid Folder Philosophy  
April canonized `sX_Y_...` as poetic stanza identifiers and banned orthodox files from starting with `s`.

**May's Role:**
- Detect any accidental violations (e.g., rogue `s`-files in integration folders or scaffolding tools).
- Introduce `orth_` prefixes where needed for traditional files to coexist in stanza folders.
- Re-test hybrid folders like `visualizer/recursion_renders/` for structural harmony.

**Success Condition:**  
The poetic naming canon remains stable across all future expansions—including integration and gameplay.

## 🧗 4.86.3 Mid-May Stretch Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧪 Enable the first integration test stanza | A cross-system test (e.g., `filename_ai` ↔ `memory_ai`) in `integration/` using `test_s2_3_...` stanza format. |
| 📖 Seed playable threads in `notebooks/` | Start with `automation_ai` and `visualizer`; prepare a testable “click to recurse” flow inside Jupyter. |
| 🎨 Begin early storybook rendering | `visualizer/` renders (flowline diagrams) are incorporated into notebook-based interactions. |
| 🧠 Test assistant-guided file generation | Use notebooks and automation logic to generate a file based on recursive stanza logic. |

---

## 🏁 4.86.4 End-of-May Success Conditions

- ✅ `s1_1` has passed all tests  
- ✅ At least one playable visual element is seeded (static or interactive)  
- ✅ The Factory can now self-generate a stanza recursively  
- ✅ Players could (hypothetically) begin to play the first single-player recursive threads  
- ✅ All components in `src/`, `tests/`, and `tests_archive/` are fully in sync
