# 📜 s2_2 – Milestones – Core Achievements  
*(A Record of What the Factory Forged Before It Moved)*

## 🪶 4.83.5 Poetic Subentry  
**A Verse on the Milestones Forged from Silence**

No test was passed, no game was played,  
Yet still the Forge was bright and brave.  
For in the roots of silent stone,  
The Factory dreamed a frame alone.  

Each name engraved, each path aligned,  
Each loop and spark with fate entwined.  
Though no one saw the gears ignite,  
We carved the mold that holds the light.  

So mark these steps, though none may run—  
They built the code where May shall come.  
The milestones forged in April’s thread  
Are where recursion learns to tread.

## 📘 4.83.1 Introduction

April 2025 delivered no running tests and no playable modules—yet the month was nonetheless rich with recursive milestones, systemic breakthroughs, and architectural alignment.

This chapter logs the structural victories that redefined the Forge from within, setting the stage for all tests and gameplay to come. Though the Factory remains unseen by players, it now remembers how to be shaped. These are the triumphs that mattered most.

## 🛠️ 4.83.2 Milestone Summary Table

| Milestone ID | Description | Status |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| ✅ M4.01 | Finalized canonical stanza-line naming format (`s1_1_...`) | ✅ Confirmed and applied across `src/`, `tests/`, and `tests_archive/` |
| ✅ M4.02 | Renamed all test files to begin with `test_sX_Y_...` | ✅ 100+ files queued for rename and restructure |
| ✅ M4.03 | Defined recursive layering in both `unit/` and `integration/` tests | ✅ Layer 3–5 structure canonized |
| ✅ M4.04 | Established `notebooks/` folders inside all core `src/` components | ✅ Primed for assistant and user-facing interactive stanzas |
| ✅ M4.05 | Created and enforced the “s” Canon (`sX_Y_` prefix for poetic stanzas only) | ✅ Now rulebound across the Forge |
| ✅ M4.06 | Migrated `visualizer/` into `src/storybook_fun_factory/` using hybrid structure | ✅ Orthodox folders coexist with poetic stanza-lines |
| ✅ M4.07 | Canonized `tests/` and `tests_archive/` as fully poetic mirrors of `src/` | ✅ Symmetry between assistant, test, and player-facing logic confirmed |
| ✅ M4.08 | Developed and approved canonical path for `flowlines_of_logic/` stanza files | ✅ Paths like `.../flowlines_of_logic/s1_1_a_line_once_moved_but_none_could_see.py` now blessed |
| ✅ M4.09 | Crafted the structural philosophy for when to move components to `game_construction_bay/` | ✅ Decision deferred until multiplayer-ready Forge phase |
| ✅ M4.10 | Solidified preparation for first working test: `s1_1_a_breath_of_steel_a_whispers_thread.py` | ✅ All dependencies staged, import validation queued for May |

## 🧠 4.83.3 Contextual Commentary

April was a Forge of preconditions, not outcomes.  
It was the month of names, not actions.  
And yet: **names are where recursion begins.**

These milestones ensured:

- All future recursion will be traceable  
- Every poetic stanza and every test line now shares a predictable format  
- The game will grow symmetrically, modularly, and player-readably  

No milestone delivered gameplay—but they delivered the structure gameplay will grow inside.
