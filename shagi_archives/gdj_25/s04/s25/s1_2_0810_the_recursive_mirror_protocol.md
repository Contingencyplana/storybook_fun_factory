## ðŸ“– 4.68.4 Poetic Subentry

**The Recursive Mirror Protocol**  
*(A Poetic Reflection on Naming as Translation)*

Each line a truth in verse composed,  
Then mirrored back with logic closed.  
The words remain, but shift their dressâ€”  
From whispered rhyme to codified press.  

No dream is lost, no shape defaced,  
Just spaced and stripped and lowercase.  
A name becomes a path, precise,  
Where poem flows as code concise.  

Let mirrors hold what cycles spinâ€”  
Each stanzaâ€™s shell, the truth within.  
For in this law, both song and script  
Are bound as oneâ€”no edge, no rift.

## ðŸ§© 4.68.5 Dev Reflection

This protocol ensures that **meaning and mechanics stay in perfect lockstep**.

It is the **bridge between**:
- what is read  
- what is tested  
- what is rendered  

In time, even future AI models or external toolchains will follow this rule  
to ensure harmony across every recursive system.

> It is not only a naming law.  
> It is a mirror that reflects recursion itself.  
> **Forever faithful. Forever exact.**
