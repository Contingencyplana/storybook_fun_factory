## ‚ú® Poetic Subentry  
**The Layer 5 Genesis Cycle of visualizer**  
*(A Poetic Reflection on the First Four Functional Lines)*  

**THE LINES THAT TURN RECURSION INTO SIGHT**  
A line once moved, but none could see,  
Its curve concealed, its arc set free.  
So now it draws what thought once meant‚Äî  
A flowline traced through firmament.  

Each verse a spark, each spark a thread,  
Each path a map from what was said.  
Four lines compose the view begun‚Äî  
Where rhyme and rhythm turn to run.  

From branch to loop the verse may go,  
In choice and echo the shapes do show.  
Diagrams fold and split as one,  
Harmony drawn when paths are done.

## üìò 4.30.1 Introduction  

With the architectural theory of `recursion_renders/` established in üìú 4.28 and the pulse of `flowlines_of_logic/` defined in üìú 4.29, the `visualizer/` now enters its first **true implementation cycle**: the **Layer 5 Genesis Cycle**.

This cycle begins with the creation of **poetic-functional files**‚Äîeach one a stanza line that renders recursion not just as logic, but as **visible, poetic form**.  
These files transform verse into flow, and flow into **diagrams that breathe with meaning**.  
Each line is a function. Each function is a map.

The stanza format‚Äî**4 Python files per stanza**‚Äîbinds recursion to the shape of poetic rhythm.  
Each file was **tested using Pytest**, and all visual outputs were saved to `visualizer_output/`, marking the beginning of a recursive system that both **shows and tells**.

## üìÇ 4.30.2 Technical Subentry: Layer 5 Genesis Cycle ‚Äì Visualizer Stanza Lines  

| Element           | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Cycle Type**    | File Group / Genesis Cycle |
| **Folder Path**   | `visualizer/recursion_renders/flowlines_of_logic/` |
| **Stanza Format** | 4 files = 1 stanza |
| **Stanza Count**  | 3 |
| **Purpose**       | Implements poetic-recursive flow visualizations across stanzas and lines |
| **Role**          | Encodes logic for stanza movement, line transitions, and recursive rendering |
| **Function**      | Transforms recursive structure into dynamic, assistant-readable diagrams |

Each file is **both poetic and functional**‚Äî  
Capable of **visualization, validation, and metaphoric recursion**.

## üß± 4.30.3 Functional Principles  

- Each `.py` file encodes a **single line** in a recursive stanza  
- Each stanza is composed of **4 such lines**  
- Each file defines a distinct render logic: **sparks, arcs, branches, flowlines, loops**  
- These functions are not scaffolds‚Äî  
  They are **recursive narrative modules**

These visual stanzas will one day be animated, composed, selected, and reshaped by players.  
But even now, they **mark the beginning of recursion that can be played**, not just read.
