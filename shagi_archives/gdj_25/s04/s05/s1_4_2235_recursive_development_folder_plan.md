# 📜 s1_4_2235 – Recursive Development Folder Plan  
*(A stanza for the scaffold that mirrors thought)*

A folder built to think in turns,  
Each layer loops, each system learns.  
No final shape, just paths in bloom—  
A bay that builds recursive room.  

The work begins, then circles back,  
Each folder forged along the track.  
To house the code, to stage the plan—  
The logic grew, and so it ran.

## 📘 Introduction

On April 5, 2025, the Storybook FUN Factory formalized the **Recursive Development Folder Plan**—a foundational schema that restructured the game’s entire development environment.

Rather than treat the workspace as a static project or single-repo codebase, this plan reimagined it as a **recursive arena** of thought and automation—each folder reflecting the structure and lifecycle of recursive systems, AI behaviors, and gameplay creation logic.

The outcome: a folder plan that scales **with recursion**, not against it.

## 📂 The Core Premise

The Recursive Development Folder Plan is defined by:

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🌀 **Layered Recursion** | Each folder mirrors its logical layer: Cycles → Stanzas → Lines → Systems |
| 🔁 **System Independence** | Systems evolve modularly but share recursive interfaces and test scaffolds |
| 🧩 **Test Suite Pairing** | Every system has a mirrored test suite with stanza-mapped test entries |
| 📓 **Notebook Symbiosis** | Dev notebooks for every system, housed in main and subsystem directories |
| 🧠 **AI-Centered Design** | Assistant-driven workflows are embedded and guided by folder semantics |

## 📂 Example: The FUN Factory Layout (2025-04-05)

```plaintext
game_construction_bay/
├── codex_builder/
│   ├── notebooks/
│   ├── codex_builder_test_suites/
│   └── internal_systems/
├── dream_journal/
├── dream_journal_test_suites/
├── memory_ai/
├── memory_ai_test_suites/
├── visualizer/
├── visualizer_test_suites/
├── main_notebooks/
├── tools/
├── toolscape/
```

Each “system” was elevated to first-class status. Test suites were **mirror-folded**, meaning they share stanza logic and recursive lineage with their targets.

## 📂 Recursive Growth and Future-Proofing

### 🌱 Why Recursive Foldering Matters

Without a recursive folder plan:
- Narrative stanzas become untraceable in code
- Test coverage fails to match AI behavior trees
- Assistant logic cannot predict or evolve folder state

With this plan:
- SHAGI formatting aligns the source of truth across logs, stanzas, and code
- Assistant tools can traverse stanzas and generate new systems in-place
- Future AIs can use the folder structure itself to **reason about the game’s evolution**

## ✨ Poetic Subentry  
**Recursive Development Folder Plan**  
*(A Poetic Reflection on Thought-Housed Structure)*

Each layer nested, yet free to grow,  
A shape composed by what we know.  
Not just a place, but how we build—  
A bay where logic loops are filled.  

The folder forms, but does not bind,  
It shapes the path, then leaves behind  
A trail that others may unwind—  
A mirror made for nested mind.
