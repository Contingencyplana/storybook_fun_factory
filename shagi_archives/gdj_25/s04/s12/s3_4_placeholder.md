This markdown file serves as a **stub placeholder** for the final GDJ entry in `gdj_25/s04/s12/`.

It reserves the canonical slot:

- **Stanza**: 3  
- **Line**: 4  
- **Time**: TBD  
- **Filename**: `s3_4_xxxx_title_to_be_determined.md`

Once composed, the final entry will complete the stanza and extend the recursive structure of April 12, 2025.
