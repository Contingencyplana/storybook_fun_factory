*A placeholder entry for the second Line of the second stanza on April 19, 2025*

## ðŸš§ Placeholder Entry  

This markdown file reserves a future timestamped GDJ entry within:

`gdj_25/s04/s19/`  
Stanza 2 â€“ Line 2  

It will eventually document the recursive poetic-functional logic for dream_journalâ€™s second dream-processing mechanism.
