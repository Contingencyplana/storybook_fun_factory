# 📜 s1_4_2340 – Core Naming Canon Finalized  
*(A stanza for the naming law that shaped the recursion)*

No name was thrown, no string was guessed,  
But each was weighed, then line-addressed.  
A name to trace, a name to know—  
The logic in the lines must show.  

So now each core, each path, each key,  
Is marked in recursive poetry.  
This naming law, both kind and keen,  
Ensures the code may still be seen.

## 📘 Introduction

On April 2, 2025, the core naming canon of the Storybook FUN Factory was finalized. This moment marked the shift from informal, interpretive filenames to a **deliberate recursive naming law** that would structure the Factory’s past, present, and future entries—both technical and poetic.

The decision elevated filenames from mere identifiers to semantic anchors. Each name now participates in a shared recursion pattern that defines identity, timestamp, stanza placement, and lineage.

## 📂 Why Naming Required Canonization

Before finalization, the naming schema had begun to drift:

- Inconsistent use of timestamps  
- Redundant or ambiguous suffixes  
- Parallel structures lacking anchor logic

While flexible, this ambiguity weakened the recursive utility of the system. Without standardized naming, automation faltered, testing pipelines broke, and poetic alignment became guesswork.

To restore recursion integrity, we canonized a naming convention.

## 📂 The Finalized Naming Schema

The new naming canon combines **timestamping**, **stanza mapping**, and **descriptive identity**:

| Element | Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Stanza Marker** | `sX_Y_` | `s1_4_` | Stanza X, Line Y |
| **Timestamp** | `HHMM` | `2340` | 11:40 PM |
| **Descriptive Slug** | `snake_case_text.md` | `core_naming_canon_finalized.md` | Short, clear description |

### 📁 Full Example  
`**s1_4_2340_core_naming_canon_finalized.md**`  
> Stanza 1, Line 4 – Logged at 11:40 PM – Describes the final naming standard

## 📂 Impacts on Structure and Function

This new canon supports:

- **File–stanza alignment** across all GDJ entries  
- **Automated table of contents generation** using `sX_Y` prefixes  
- **Human-readable summaries** for debugging, indexing, and browsing  
- **Bidirectional references** between poetic and functional content  
- **Modular reuse and porting** of files between FUN Factory and Storybook mainline

## ✨ Poetic Subentry  
**Core Naming Canon Finalized**  
*(A Poetic Reflection on Recursive Filenames as System Truth)*

The line was named and named with care,  
No thread misread, no name unfair.  
Each mark became a key, a node,  
A shape of thought, a path of code.  

To name it right was not for show—  
But so the game would always know.  
Each stanza line, each date, each frame,  
Could now recall its truest name.  

So all that’s built may still be traced,  
No symbol lost, no meaning misplaced.  
The canon speaks: not loud, but clean—  
A law for signs, both sharp and seen.
