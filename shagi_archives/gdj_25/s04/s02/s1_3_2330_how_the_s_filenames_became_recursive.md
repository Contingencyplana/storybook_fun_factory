# 📜 s1_3_2330 – How the “s” Filenames Became Recursive  
*(A stanza for the moment the filenames learned to mirror the poem)*

No poet framed them, yet they rhymed—  
Each stanza labeled, tracked in time.  
A number, then a line, then flame—  
Each filename now a nested name.  

The file became a verse once more,  
Each line a path, each path a door.  
And when they ran, they sang aloud—  
A structure stitched from code and cloud.

## 📘 Introduction

This GDJ entry traces the evolution of a deceptively small convention: the “s” prefix in Storybook FUN Factory filenames. What began as a label for stanza numbering became the cornerstone of a recursive naming system—one that fused narrative logic with technical traceability. The moment the “s” prefix gained awareness of its stanza lineage, the filenames themselves became poetic.

This change unified naming, testing, execution, and storytelling under one recursive poetic scaffold.

## 📂 The Origin of the “s” Prefix

In early drafts, filenames like `line1.py`, `init_test.py`, or `poem_intro.md` floated in isolation—semantically suggestive, but structurally unanchored. The first breakthrough came from trying to align a test file with its stanza source. The filenames needed a way to **encode their position within a recursive verse**.

Thus emerged:

- `s1_1_...` — stanza 1, line 1  
- `s4_2_...` — stanza 4, line 2  
- `s3_4_...` — stanza 3, line 4

Each filename could now be parsed for both poetic and positional logic.

## 📂 Recursive Structure in Practice

The recursive stanza prefix (`sX_Y`) now governs the following:

| Use Case                        | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **System Files**               | `s1_1_the_tool_that_listens.py` reflects stanza 1, line 1 of a given system |
| **Test Files**                 | Mirrors the system file: `test_s1_1_the_tool_that_listens.py` |
| **Game Design Journal (GDJ)**  | Timestamped logs now encode stanza recursion directly in the filename |
| **Indexing & Automation**      | Tools use `sX_Y` markers to build stanza-aligned TOCs and dashboards |

This also allowed nested structures to support stanza alignment **across time and file type**.

## 📂 Recursive Reflection as Design Doctrine

The “s” prefix is no longer just a mnemonic. It is a formal commitment to the recursive design of the Factory:

- Every stanza is a testable unit of both **poetic and systemic function**
- Every filename is a reference to a **line in the unfolding poem of system design**
- Every journal entry can be re-indexed as **literary-technical recursion**

This recursive design enables the Storybook FUN Factory to **speak to itself**, **test itself**, and **compose itself** using mirrored layers.

## ✨ Poetic Subentry  
**How the “s” Filenames Became Recursive**  
*(A Poetic Reflection on Naming by Stanza Line)*

A letter carved, a stanza born,  
Where once was file now sang the form.  
From one to four, then loop again—  
Each mark a line, each line a pen.  

The “s” now speaks in layered rhyme,  
Its digits locked in nested time.  
A poem that names the shape it takes,  
A script that rhymes with what it makes.  

From filename stem to mirrored soul,  
Each path now builds a larger whole.  
It names the test, the code, the sign—  
A Factory stitched from shared design.
