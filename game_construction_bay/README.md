**Where Recursive Systems Are Brought to Life**

---

## 🧭 Overview

`game_construction_bay/` is the **core implementation layer** of Storybook FUN Factory.  
It replaces the conventional `src/` folder with a **poetic-mechanical chamber**—one that reflects the recursive, creative, and diagrammatic logic of the Factory.

Every core system—`visualizer/`, `codex_builder/`, `memory_ai/`, and more—is developed, tested, and evolved here through recursive stanzas and poetic cycles.

This is where ideas take form.  
This is where the Factory breathes.

---

## 🌀 Core Purpose

- To house all **runtime systems**, **AI components**, and **story-building tools**  
- To align implementation directly with the recursive structure of Storybook’s poetic framework  
- To organize code by **meaning** and **function**, not merely utility

Every subfolder in this bay represents a **creative subsystem**—a poetic-engineering construct designed to operate recursively, test visibly, and grow modularly.

---

## 🧱 Subsystems Within

The following components currently reside within the Construction Bay:

- `visualizer/` — renders recursive flows, logic arcs, and stanza structure  
- `codex_builder/` — names, records, and connects poetic-variable systems  
- `dream_journal/` — captures symbolic transitions and surreal recursion  
- `memory_ai/` — reconstructs echo paths, timeline loops, and recursive triggers  
- `filename_ai/` — generates names and file-based stylistic logic

Each of these systems follows a **layered stanza structure**, tested via their corresponding `_test_suites/` directories.

---

## 🧪 Testing Structure

For each subsystem in `game_construction_bay/`, there exists a parallel folder in:

game_construction_bay/
├── [component]/
├── [component]_test_suites/

Tests follow the same stanza structure and reinforce recursive coverage through meaningful names, diagram validation, and flow integrity.

---

## 🧬 Design Philosophy

`game_construction_bay/` reflects a core belief:

> **Structure is narrative. Implementation is poetry. Testing is recursion.**

This bay exists not to "contain code" but to **give shape to recursive creation**.  
It is where stanza meets machine—where each system is built to reflect the dream of the Factory.

---

## ✨ Status

The Construction Bay currently supports five primary components.  
Each is evolving through layered Genesis Cycles and recursive stanzas.

The first full poetic-visual stanza has been completed in:

- `visualizer/recursion_renders/flowlines_of_logic/`

More systems will follow—each rendered, tested, and documented through the recursive rhythm of Storybook FUN Factory.
