**Stanza-Based Diagram Logic**

---

## üß≠ Overview

`recursion_renders/` is the first recursive layer beneath `visualizer/`.  
It introduces stanza-based rendering‚Äîwhere each file is a **line** in a structured **stanza**, and each stanza forms a recursive unit of visual logic.

This folder is where flowlines begin to breathe.

## üåÄ Core Purpose

The purpose of `recursion_renders/` is to encode stanza-based poetic logic into **graphical renderings**. Each file in this folder:

- Implements a single line of a recursive stanza  
- Generates a visual diagram using `networkx + matplotlib`  
- Reflects a conceptual or narrative shift within recursive flow  
- Is tightly bound to its corresponding test file for validation

---

## üß© Structural Convention

Each stanza is composed of **4 Python files**, each representing a **line of visual recursion**.  
The naming format reflects poetic structure:

The naming format reflects poetic structure:

```
_1_1_a_line_once_moved_but_none_could_see.py
_1_2_its_curve_concealed_its_arc_set_free.py
_1_3_so_now_it_draws_what_thought_once_meant.py
_1_4_a_flowline_traced_through_firmament.py
```

These files collectively form **Stanza 1** of the `flowlines_of_logic/` cycle.

Each stanza may belong to a larger **Cycle**, and Cycles may belong to a **Poem**, aligning with Storybook FUN Factory's recursive poetic hierarchy.
