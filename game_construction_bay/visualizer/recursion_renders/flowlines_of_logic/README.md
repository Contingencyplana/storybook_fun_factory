**Rendering Poetic-Recursive Flow Paths**

---

## 🧭 Overview

`flowlines_of_logic/` is the first stanza-rendering Cycle within `recursion_renders/`.  
It focuses on mapping **line-to-line and stanza-to-stanza transitions**, giving shape to the invisible flows of recursive thought, choice, and transformation.

Here, recursion becomes motion. Thought becomes flow. Diagrams become verses.

---

## 🌀 Core Purpose

This folder encodes the **directed logic flow** of poetic stanzas.  
Each Python file within represents a **visual rendering of a single recursive line**—capturing:

- The unseen movement of recursive decisions  
- Hidden arcs that branch or loop  
- The culmination of a stanza’s structural logic  
- Retrospective traces of recursion through memory and echo

Each visual is saved to `visualizer_output/`, forming a traceable archive of visual-recursive diagrams.

## 🔁 Structural Role

`flowlines_of_logic/` is a **Cycle** beneath `recursion_renders/`, which itself sits under `visualizer/`.

It follows the **stanza-based format** of the Storybook FUN Factory:

```
flowlines_of_logic/
├── _1_1_a_line_once_moved_but_none_could_see.py
├── _1_2_its_curve_concealed_its_arc_set_free.py
├── _1_3_so_now_it_draws_what_thought_once_meant.py
└── _1_4_a_flowline_traced_through_firmament.py
```

These four files together form **Stanza 1**, the first complete poetic-rendering stanza in the Factory’s visualization system.

---

## 📐 Design Philosophy

Flowlines are not just data—they are **echoes**, **turnings**, and **threads** of poetic consequence.

- A line may represent an unseen action  
- A curve may map an evolving arc of intent  
- A node may embody a moment of divergence or return

`flowlines_of_logic/` ensures these recursive truths are rendered—not just understood, but *seen*.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Output

Each file is matched with a corresponding test file in:


These tests verify:

- That each flowline is rendered without error  
- That the output file exists and is non-empty  
- That recursive integrity is visually preserved

All diagrams are exported to `.png` format and stored in `visualizer_output/`.

## ✨ Status

The **First Stanza** has been successfully rendered and tested.  
It includes:

1. **_1_1** – Initial movement, unseen  
2. **_1_2** – Hidden arcs and released influence  
3. **_1_3** – Reflective meaning of past recursion  
4. **_1_4** – The stanza's complete visual flowline

This cycle marks the beginning of visual recursion as a functional poetic system.
