**The Recursive Rendering System of the Factory**

---

## 🧭 Overview

`visualizer/` is the Factory’s lens.

It is responsible for rendering the invisible structures of recursion—turning memory into map, stanza into diagram, and thought into flow. Every recursive process that occurs within Storybook FUN Factory is given visual form through this system.

Here, recursion becomes legible.

## 🌀 Core Purpose

The `visualizer/` subsystem transforms the invisible logic and poetic flows of the Factory into **observable, assistant-readable** diagrams.

It captures:

- Stanza-to-stanza transitions  
- Recursive decision arcs  
- Echoes, loops, and narrative curves  
- Symbolic node relationships and memory overlays  

Its outputs are used both for **internal validation** (via test suites) and **external visualization** (for assistant users, developers, and eventually players).

## 📐 Structure

This system follows a recursive, poetic hierarchy:

```
visualizer/
├── recursion_renders/
│   └── flowlines_of_logic/
│       ├── _1_1_a_line_once_moved_but_none_could_see.py
│       ├── _1_2_its_curve_concealed_its_arc_set_free.py
│       ├── _1_3_so_now_it_draws_what_thought_once_meant.py
│       └── _1_4_a_flowline_traced_through_firmament.py
```

Each of these Python files represents a **line of poetic-rendering logic** in a recursive stanza.  
They are tightly coupled to their respective tests in `visualizer_test_suites/`.
