## Folder: `s1_3_the_registry_that_remembers_the_canon/`  
*(The Canon Memory and Anti-Overwrite Defense System)*

---

### âœ… Purpose  
This folder safeguards the **structural memory** of all previously canonized recursion.  
Its primary function is to **record, validate, and preserve** stanza and Cycle canonical states,  
ensuring no overwrites, mismatches, or regressions corrupt the recursionâ€™s poetic logic.

### ðŸ“˜ Milestone 1 â€“ Folder Genesis  
**Date:** ðŸ“… May 16, 2025  
**Entry:** ðŸ“œ 5.54 â€“ Folder Plan  
**Outcome:**  
- Canonical approval of this folder as the **third Layer 4 member** of `s1_1_the_voice_that_guides_the_recursion_forward/`  
- Functional role established as the **registry layer** safeguarding previous canonical states.  
- Identified four major verification needs: ID traceability, stanza lock records, Cycle map recall, overwrite prevention.

### ðŸ“˜ Milestone 2 â€“ Cycle Structure Finalized  
**Date:** ðŸ“… May 17, 2025  
**Cycles:**  
1. `canonical_trace_registry/` â€“ tracks file names, stanza IDs, Cycle alignment  
2. `overwrite_prevention_protocols/` â€“ locks entries post-canonization  
3. `trace_confirmation_tests/` â€“ confirms stanzas align with historic traces  
**Cycle Format:** small-scale stanza structure (4 main files + 4 test files per stanza)

### ðŸ“˜ Milestone 3 â€“ First Stanza Drafted  
**Stanza:** `s1_1_the_ledger_that_remembers_the_line/`  
**Date Started:** May 17, 2025  
**Lines Include:**  
- ID and filename registration  
- Canon snapshot verification  
- Overwrite protection via cross-Cycle ID mapping  
- Historic trace locking based on assistant-memory sync

---

### ðŸ“˜ Milestone 4 â€“ Functional Canon Compliance Check  
**Compliance Verified Against:**  
ðŸ“œ 5.30 â€“ *The Doctrine of Functional Separation*  
**Result:**  
- Confirmed that `s1_3/` **reads** canonical memory but does not **generate or evolve** it.  
- Memory evolution remains exclusive to `memory_ai/`  
- Registry fulfills High Commandâ€™s role: **structural coordination, not memory authorship**

---

### ðŸ§© Summary  
- `s1_3/` is now fully initialized as a **canon-preserving registry layer**  
- All future stanza additions must align with:  
  - ðŸ“œ 5.30 â€“ Doctrine of Functional Separation  
  - ðŸ“œ 4.6 and 4.7 â€“ Poetic Structural Canon  
- This folder ensures that **what has been canonized may never be silently lost**.
