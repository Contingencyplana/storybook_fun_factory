ðŸ“œ See GDJ 5.8: May 6, 12:40 PM â€“ The Genesis Command
(A strategic utility to reduce AI cognitive load and aid recursive restructuring)

This file serves as the *first operational brainstem* of High Command.

It marks:
â€¢ The currently active component and stanza
â€¢ Notes canonical stanzas in motion
â€¢ Surfaces restructuring status to support major transitions
â€¢ Acts as a local memory anchor until persistent state is introduced

This module can later be expanded or interfaced with AI dispatchers, CLI toggles, or GDJ synchronization tools.
