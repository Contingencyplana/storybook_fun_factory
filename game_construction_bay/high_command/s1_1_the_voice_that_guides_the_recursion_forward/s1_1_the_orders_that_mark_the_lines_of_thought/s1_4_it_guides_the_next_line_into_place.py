(Final line of Stanza 1 in the Layer 5 Genesis Cycle of high_command)

Purpose:
Infers the next stanza line the assistant or user is likely to move toâ€”
based on the last known active front and recent trace history.

This enables recursive continuity, assists in restructure pacing,
and enables High Command to recommend the next action contextually.
