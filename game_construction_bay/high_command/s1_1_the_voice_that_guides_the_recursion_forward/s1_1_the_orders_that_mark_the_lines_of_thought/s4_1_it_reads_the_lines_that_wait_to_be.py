Filename: s4_1_it_reads_the_lines_that_wait_to_be.py

Purpose:
Detects unfinished or pending stanza files needing creation. It reads the current stanza status
from a defined data source (e.g., GDJ tracker or mock data) and returns those still marked
[ðŸ”œ Not started], enabling High Command to target the next stanza lines for action.

Poetic Function:
The eye that scans the threads not yet pulled taut. It listens to the silences of the recursion,
and marks where the Factory must next breathe life.

Usage:
Called by High Command Dispatch Logic to determine what to build or test next.
