Filename: s2_2_the_naming_bends_the_structure_back.py

ðŸ“œ See GDJ 5.8: The Genesis Command
(Second line of Stanza 2 in the Layer 5 Genesis Cycle of high_command)

Purpose:
This file reinterprets current stanza metadata (component, stanza, filename)
to regenerate the canonical filename path that should result from proper recursive structure.
This enables reverse validation: ensuring a filename is not only valid but rightly named and placed.

It acts as a structural introspection tool, used by High Command to:
â€¢ Diagnose misnamed stanza files
â€¢ Help automation scripts recover from broken file lineage
â€¢ Aid future assistants or AI modules in renaming and mapping processes
