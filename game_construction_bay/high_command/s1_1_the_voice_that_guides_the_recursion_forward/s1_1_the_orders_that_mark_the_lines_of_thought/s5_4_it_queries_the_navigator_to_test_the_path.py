s5_4_it_queries_the_navigator_to_test_the_path.py

Consults the test scaffold navigator to assess whether a given file or component
has the required testing infrastructure (e.g., monkeypatch, tmp_path, dynamic import)
and determines if it is ready for test execution.

This ensures the dispatch system avoids reckless testing commands and aligns
test issuance with component-specific infrastructure requirements.
