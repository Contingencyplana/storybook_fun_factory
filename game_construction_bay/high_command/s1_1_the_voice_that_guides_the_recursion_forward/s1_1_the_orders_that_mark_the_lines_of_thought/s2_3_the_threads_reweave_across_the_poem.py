ðŸ“œ See GDJ 5.8: May 6 â€“ The Genesis Command
(Third line of Stanza 2 in the Layer 5 Genesis Cycle of high_command)

Purpose:
Given an expected stanza structure and a list of existing filenames,
this tool identifies any missing lines and prepares them for generation.

This allows High Command to determine what remains undone
in a recursive stanza, aiding both assistant and player workflows.
