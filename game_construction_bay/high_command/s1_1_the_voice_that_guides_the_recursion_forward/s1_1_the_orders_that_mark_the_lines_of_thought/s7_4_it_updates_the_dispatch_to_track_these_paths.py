"""
Filename: s7_4_it_updates_the_dispatch_to_track_these_paths.py

Feeds updated zone status into the Dispatch Logic system.

This function takes a classified Zone Map and determines whether
any dispatch targets should change in priority or scope based on recent heat.

It acts as a feedback mechanism â€” aligning strategic awareness with tactical output.

It is the Factoryâ€™s instinct to turn attention where itâ€™s most needed.
