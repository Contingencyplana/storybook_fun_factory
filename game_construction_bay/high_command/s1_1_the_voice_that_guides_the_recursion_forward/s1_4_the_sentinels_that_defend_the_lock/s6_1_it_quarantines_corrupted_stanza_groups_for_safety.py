Filename: s6_1_it_quarantines_corrupted_stanza_groups_for_safety.py

Poetic-Functional Description:
This stanza line initiates the recovery process by scanning for stanza folders marked
as corrupted, tainted, or structurally suspect. Upon identification, it relocates the
entire stanza group into a designated quarantine zone within the recursive file system.
This ensures that no further recursion, repair, or assistant execution occurs against
potentially dangerous logic until explicit recovery or rollback is initiated.

It is the first and most important act of recursive containmentâ€”moving damage out of
reach without yet attempting restoration.

Core Responsibilities:
- Scan for corrupted stanza markers or flags.
- Move affected folders to the quarantine directory.
- Log the quarantine event with metadata (time, original path, reason).

Example Usage:
>>> quarantine_corrupted_stanza_groups("game_construction_bay")
[
  ("game_construction_bay/filename_ai/broken_stanza", "quarantine_zone/broken_stanza__20250518T041032Z"),
  ...
]
