Filename: s6_2_it_attempts_reconstruction_from_memory_or_archivist.py

Poetic-Functional Description:
This stanza line attempts to restore corrupted or quarantined stanza groups
by consulting two recursive memory sources: memory_ai and archivist_ai.
memory_ai provides the most recently cached stanza logic,
while archivist_ai provides last-known-good canonical blueprints.

If both sources agree, reconstruction proceeds automatically.
If they disagree, memory_ai is used as primary (latest logic), unless
an override flag exists preferring the archivist's version.

This function does not write to canon folders directly.
It performs a simulated restoration and returns the proposed content
for later validation and staging.

Core Responsibilities:
- Read quarantine logs to identify target folders
- Query memory_ai and archivist_ai for stanza reconstructions
- Compare outputs and select the safer restoration
- Return a list of reconstructed stanza proposals with trace metadata

Example Usage:
>>> results = attempt_reconstruction("quarantine_zone/logs/quarantine_log.txt")
>>> results[0]["source"]  # "memory_ai" or "archivist_ai"
