    """
    Applies syntactic styling to a poetic filename to enhance rhythm and parsing clarity.

    Responsibilities:
    - Collapses triple or double underscores into single
    - Ensures no leading or trailing underscores
    - Preserves all lowercase slug formatting
    - Adds extra underscore between logical breaks (e.g., after every 4th word) if needed

    Parameters:
        poetic_filename (str): The unstyled poetic filename, assumed to be lowercase and underscore-based

    Returns:
        str: A syntactically styled filename string
